Plays/Musicals.</div>Hi ho. Well, this is my little fic site. It's not to splended yet but as more inspiration comes that will soon change. But since this is the Bio part of the site, here's some info about me. I'm a second year student in college. I'm studying to be an actress (I hope). I love the stage, singing, dancing, and being generally silly. Of course, you can't be truely silly and wacky all by your lonesome so I'm usually off causing mayhem with my bestest friends in the whole wide world (you five know who you are). I'm a gemini/taurus cusp. (I'm not quite sure why I'm adding that, but it's rare, so it's cool.) I love food (eating, prepairing, eating...). Movies are also a hobbie of mine, I swear my house looks like a Suncoast store! I love to read. Some of my favorites are Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, The lord of the Rings trilogy, The Hobbit, Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series, Elfquest comics, Marvel comics (especially X-Men and Spiderman), and J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. I'm also into broadway a whole lot and hope to perform there one day. Some of my favorite musicals: CATS, RENT, Phantom of the Opera, Sound of Music, Grease, Les Mis, Guys and Dolls, and a few more that I can't remeber right now.<br/>Ok, I think I've bored you enough with that sort of stuff...Moving on!<br/>Here are some of my favorite quotes and inside jokes. Don't ask questions just read and chuckle.<br/>"I'm one of those bad things that happens to good people."<br/>"Be like a duck: calm on the surface, but paddling like Hell underneath."<br/>"If a mute kid swears, does his mother wash his hands with soap?"<br/>"She may not look nice kid, but she's got it where it counts."<br/>"Look out, it's a drunken eagle!"<br/>"Beware of the I.E!"<br/>"Alonzo! Gimme back my tail or you'll be purple forever!"<br/>"Marius, Marius, Marius, Marius!"<br/>"Snape is GOD!"<br/>"Then suddenly, an unconcious argentinian fell through my roof followed by a midgette dressed like a nun!"<br/>"I'll tell you in another life, when we're both cats."<br/>"The sweet is always better after the sour."<br/>"Enjoy this minute, it's your life."<br/>"When I say rare, I mean let it stare at the oven in terror, then bring it out to me!"<br/>"P.S. I LOVE SNAPE!"<br/>"Wuz up H.G?"<br/>"Shibby."<br/>"You cannot ignore the shibby!"<br/>"You must BE the shibby!"<br/>"Let the shibby flow through you."<br/>"Love the shibby, embrace the shibby."<br/>"Lelio, mon amour, save me?"<br/>"Lomihahamech, Lemujorosabr, Nialripiro, Parufrsa, Clboarho, Jeelcahesa."<br/>"Random rainbows holding random microphones under random roadboxes with random people."<br/>"Holly, guess what!?"<br/>"Random Wolverine moment, Grrr!"<br/>"Random Gimli moment, ARRGG!"<br/>"I will, Normal you, Slinky you, Pounce you, and then I'll Shibby you!"<br/>"My mom said I'll never amount to anything because I procrastinate, I said: just wait."<br/>"Life is anything that dies when you step on it."<br/>"I used to be skitzofrenzic, but we're okay now."<br/>"You're what I never knew I always wanted."<br/>"Just because you're not paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you."<br/>"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. And if you still can't do it after that, then you've spent a lot of time trying to do something you couldn't do in the first place."<br/>"I feel like I'm perpendicularly parked in a paralell universe."<br/>"Everyone has a photographic memory, some just don't have film."<br/>"Sorry, I can't think of an insult stupid enough for you."<br/>"A day without sunshine is like.. well.. night.."<br/>"Before you criticize someone, walk a mile in their shoes. That way, if they get angry, they'll be a mile away and barefoot."<br/>"Don't look back, somebody might be gaining on you."<br/>"If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door."<br/>"You may think you know, but you have no idea."<br/>"Some people are alive only because manslaughter is illegal."<br/>"Pain is a part of the growing experience.. so go slam your head into a wall and mature a little."<br/>"HA, I say! HA! And double HA! HAHA! HAHAHA and a disbelieving chortle too." (This is from: Remembering Alice, a FANTASTIC Megavolt fic by Maincoon!)<br/>"You know, every person in your dreams is actually you.. even if it's somebody you hate, it's just some part of you you can't stand."<br/>"Megavolt: Darkwing duck? He is NOT deserving of a title THAT cool! Bushroot: Darkwing Duck? More like Dipwing Dork."<br/>"The truth? You can't handle the truth! No, truth handler are you! Bah! I deride your truth-handling abilities!"<br/>"That was a well-plotted piece of non-claptrap that never made me want to retch."<br/>"Very funny Scotty, now beam up my clothes."<br/>"I brake for imaginary creatures only I can see."<br/>"If you love something, let it go. If it comes back, it's yours forever. If it doesn't... hunt it down and kill it!"<br/>"Women, now you see them, now you don't."<br/>"Jesus is coming; everybody look busy!"<br/>"When I'm quiet, you'd better find me.."<br/>"I put the 'fun' in dysfunctional."<br/>"God made us sisters, Prozac made us friends."<br/>"Is it time for your medication or mine?"<br/>"I just got lost in thought! Unfamillar territory.."<br/>"Been there, done that.. don't remember most of it."<br/>"Bad cop! No doughnut!"<br/>"My mind not only wanders, it sometimes leaves completely!"<br/>"This is NOT the life I ordered!"<br/>"What happens if you get scared half to death.. twice?"<br/>"You're depriving some poor village of it's idiot."<br/>"I want to die peacefully in my sleep like my grandfather... not screaming and yelling like the people in his car."<br/>"Out of my mind... back in 5 minutes."<br/>"If you drink don't park! Remember: accidents cause people!"<br/>"It's been lovely, but I have to scream now."<br/>"If it ain't broke.. fix it till it is!"<br/>"Few women admit their age... fewer men act theirs."<br/>"How can I miss you if you won't go away?"<br/>"I don't suffer from insanity! I enjoy every minute of it!"<br/>"Money doesn't talk.. it swears."<br/>"The light at the end of the tunnel is an approaching train!"<br/>"It's hard to think of you as the result of millions of years of evolution."<br/>"The world is 98% full, delete anyone you can!"<br/>"Join the navy! Sail to far-off exotic places, meet interesting people... then kill them."<br/>"If 'pro' is the opposite of 'con', what is the opposite of Progress?"<br/>"I always thought I'd look back on us crying and laugh.. I never thought I'd look back on us laughing.. and cry."<br/>"Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened."<br/>"A memory is what is left when something happens that never truly unhappens."<br/>"If you cry because the sun has gone from your life, your tears will prevent you from seeing the stars."<br/>"This life is only a test.

Somebody just moved my street.."<br/>"It was so dark, I couldn't see my hand behind my back!"<br/>"Give me a dingle I'll call you on the dangle. Call the old number we'll give you the new one.. and while I'm at it, I'm gonna chef your boy-r-dee."<br/>" " -Harpo Marx<br/>"It's generally agreed that 'hello' is the apropriate greeting. Because if you walked into a room and said 'goodbye', it could cause confusion.."<br/>"I never forget a face.. but in your case I'll make an exception."<br/>"This isn't right! This isn't even wrong!"<br/>"Life is a comedy to those who think, and a tragedy to those who feel."<br/>"The inspiring Maharaja with teeth from the Moulin Rouge and the asthamtic lion with overactive eyebrows who live in the little bitty house wanna know if you're going to the prom, or if you're gonna be in Grease so we can breed 'em. But if we breed 'em, then they'll kill each other 'cause they're pyschos. Just like Darkwing Duck! With his stupid mask and stupid hat and stupid cape and stupid gas gun. He's so stupid, that I, Megavolt, and my friends, Bushroot, The Liquid *pause* ator and QuackerJack will have to kill him. But we won't invite *Dun dun dun* Negaduck, because *dun dun dun* Negaduck will throw 'The Switch' to 'Put out the Darkwing! Put out the Darkwing!' And our relationship with him has been squeltured. P.S. I am the Green Fairy, and my job is to torture Chelsea! Torture Chelsea!" (Hey, guys, did I miss anything? Hehehehe..)<br/>"Excuse me, is this the lost and found? Because I found you, and you lose!" *I love Megsy.. ;) *<br/>"Oh, yeah yeah, somebody call the Waaahmbulance. Did you order a wahhmburger with thos frenchcries?"<br/>"FRANK IS LIVING IN MY FOOT!"<br/>"I prefer to do it standing... Oh, no, no you don't have to stand.. it's, well, you see sometimes.. well, it's very long and I want you to be comfortable. You see, it's very modern what I do, but.. but I think that if you're open to it.. you'll enjoy it!"<br/>"I'll ask you tomorrow, after school, after I'm done gloating." HA HA HA SARAH!
