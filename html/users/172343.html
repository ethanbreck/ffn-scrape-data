Whee. ...EVERYONE'S ASLEEP IN THE MINDSPACE, I'M STUCK AT SCHOOL AND NO ONE THAT IS HERE IS WORTH TALKING TO, I HAVE NO LUNCH OR MONEY, I CAN'T THINK VERY WELL, I'M REEEEEEEEALLY TIRED, I HAVE TO BE IN MATH CLASS, AND I DON'T GET TO GO TO JAPANESE TODAY. *breaks down and starts crying*<br/>Wufei:You silly woman, I'm awake, you're ALWAYS stuck at school, there's at least four people worth talking to, you can sponge off them, I'll help you through today because you obviously have very small intelligence today, it's your fault you stayed up last night, math is required, and you'll go to Japanese tomorrow! *sighs exaperatedly and drags her back to Geometry*<br/>This whole bloody thing is messed up. Read it if you want, but I'm still trying to figure out stuff and deal with the shittiness that is FF.net sometimes. Sorry it's just my pretty much PERMANENT writer's block got broken because I started just writing stream-of-concioussness and I tangent a HELL of a lot, and whenever possible I write stream-of-concioussness and that isn't at ALL conductive to writing a bio. So basically...shit, forget it, I'm going to bed, read it if you bloody want. It's too late for this. G'night minna. *shuffles off grumbling about editing in the morning*<p>Alex:Okay. THIS is the last time I try to downsize my bio. If I start babbling then tough shit. Well actually I'll probably come back and fix it YET again. Um. Anyway, I'll do sections: Mindspace, Stats, Stories, 'Ships. Damn. Why does this feel like a middle-school paper? Nevermind.</p><p>Mindspace.<br/>My explination for why the mindspace exists is because I am VERY visually-oriented, and a story is like a movie, etc. etc. Also my writing began as roleplaying, and if you don't know what that is-okay, trying to stay on track. I really need a website so that I can babble all I want and people can look at it if they want ^_^ ...anyway. So the mindspace exists. It's where I interact with the other people that live here (will be explained in a minute) and they interact with each other. Therefore, it is also where my reviews take place. Also it's where my online conversations with Kiki *waves enthusiastically to her best friend!!* happen-but that's beside the subject. MUST STAY ON TOPIC. Where was I? Oh yes. Well, although things are added to the mindspace every once in awhile, right now it's pretty plain, allowing for lots of creativity seeing as anybody can create pretty much anything here-<br/>Duo:ANYthing? *waggles his eyebrows and hentai grins*<br/>Alex:Go AWAY Duo, we'll talk later! I MUST STAY FOCUSED! *pushes him away behind the curtain*<br/>Duo*grumbles* Okay, okay, I'm going, I'm going...<br/>Alex:Um. Will all be explained later. Must establish basics first. *rubs forehead* I think I'm getting a headache from concentrating this hard...usually I just leave the in-control stuff up to Michiko 'cuze she actually LIKES being in charge...I don't like having to mind my manners and all that shit, but I have to do this because I know it the best because I've a)been here the longest, and b)the actual "real" person, the quotes are there because some people's ideas of reality differ. *shrugs* Everybody seems pretty real. The reason why I don't test crazy is because I _know_ they only exist in my head. Though I must point out that just because they have no physical bodies does not make them any less real. Oh the third reason why I'm doing this is because I'm more or less the dominant person. Though I'm not in charge usually, Michiko is-dammit! I'm going in circles AND rambling! MUST! KEEP! CONTROL! Okay where was I...oh yeah, I'll describe the mindspace to you now...</p><p>It's huge. There are no walls or ceiling most of the time, unless someone needs one for something and when there are walls they're usually clear. If there is ever a ceiling it's white, usually. It's all lit up-lately sunlight-coming-in-a-window light has been popular because people keep going into cat-forms...not a bad thing. Oh also every once in a while there'll be a convient velvet pillow in a convient patch of sunlight, and it'll be taken...mm...*whaps self* FOCUSED! Um yeah. If you try to look for the edges of the room or the ceiling when it hasn't been defined you get...uncomfortable, and your eyes hurt, so try not to. I speak from experience. *rubs eyes in memory* Um...anyway, the floor-*grins* it used to be boring white, and then I changed it! Now, it's glass, and you can see through it to clear tropical waters with fish and stuff. Don't worry; you can't go through it unless you want to, like this! *dips her bare foot through the previously solid floor, takes it out dripping, shakes it off. the droplets pause on the again-solid floor, then sink through.* Hmm. It's cold right now, it was warm earlier... *jumps on the spot she previously dipped her foot in* See? Safe. Well you probably won't visit unless you get to know me real well, so it doesn't really matter...*shrugs* I guess I want to show you my home-well my mental home anyway, that's what this place has become...Anyway. Gaah! I got distracted again! .</p><p>Alex:Hello, I'm Alex. I decided to re-do my bio for the what, fourth time?<br/>Michiko:Sixth time.<br/>Alex:Yeah, the sixth time. This time I'm going to try not to get distracted, and tell you pertient information. I do have to warn you that there are several other people in my head that like their say, so look for butting in. And by the way I'm not insane and I have the tests to prove it, so don't ask ^_^<br/>Michiko:No matter what she does...<br/>Alex:Well actually I don't care, but maybe it'll cut down on the amount of stupid questions. Stupid questions breed more stupid questions with the occasional mutation to a silly question. Whoohoo, I'm making stuff up as I go along! ^_^<br/>Michiko:Usually she's not this happy, we don't know what makes her this happy, it's never happened before...<br/>Duo:Getting laid makes ME that happy...*hentai grin*<br/>Michiko:So THAT'S what makes you so bouncy! I'd wondered.<br/>Duo*nods* Yup. Heero is my Prosac. *bounces off*<br/>Alex:Hmm. I wonder what would happen if we tried to take him off his addiction to Heero cold turkey?<br/>Michiko:Depressed and suicidal Duo, most likely...*Alex and Michiko shudder*<br/>Alex:Better not write any agnst.<br/>Michiko:Wasn't really planning on making you write any...<br/>Alex:'Suppose I should get back on track, ne?<br/>Michiko:Yeah.<br/>Alex:Michiko is my muse. Well, sorta...<br/>Michiko:Whaddya mean, 'sorta'?<br/>Alex:Well, the ideas don't come from you.<br/>Michiko:But I help you with your stories...<br/>Alex:Technically a muse is an inspiration.<br/>Michiko:I'm still your muse though, right? None of the others help.<br/>Alex*grins* Yup! It's just that you mostly do other stuff-<br/>Michiko:'Cuze you haven't been writing *glare* C'mon, we have a fan!<br/>Alex*grin* TECHnically we have 14, because it's Kiki and Company...<br/>Michiko:Oh yes. *at the same time, Alex and Michiko wave and yell* HI KIKI AND EVERYBODY!<br/>Alex*grins* And a special hello to Sha-mmph!<br/>Michiko*put a hand over her mouth* Remember that KIKI doesn't want her real name out...<br/>Alex*licks Michiko's hand*<br/>Michiko:GAAH! *lets go* You sicko!<br/>Alex*spits* Eew, what have you been touching?<br/>Michiko*hentai grin*<br/>Alex:Oh...*facefault* I can't beleive you didn't wash your hands afterwards...<br/>Michiko:I didn't have time, you dragged me to do this!<br/>Alex:Go. Now.<br/>Michiko*grins still in place, strolls off*<br/>Alex:Joy! I am alone for once!<br/>The Anubis Twins*stare at her back*<br/>Alex*turns around, jumps a little* Don't do that!<br/>The Anubis Twins:~We are doing nothing.~<br/>Alex*sigh...*<br/>The Anubis Twins:~Were you not going to speak?<br/>Alex:Yeah. Thought I was alone.<br/>The Anubis Twins:~What difference does it make?~<br/>Alex:I wanted no comments.<br/>The Anubis Twins*bow heads* ~It shall be as you wish.~ *they fade out*<br/>Alex:Okay! Now the thing I wanted to say was that I AM the original entity, and am therefore the writer and the owner of the actual, physical body that goes places and types and so on. This should explain my appearance when I describe it. Everybody else is a tiny bit outlandish *grin* Big title so that the authors that are just looking for an explination...:</p><p>IF YOU'RE AN AUTHOR AND MY REVIEW OF YOUR PIECE(S) DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, THE ANSWERS ARE HERE. PROBABLY.</p><p>Alex:Okay. This is for the authors I review that are confused and come to this page for explinations, mostly, because everybody in here that wants to comments on their pieces, so you usually get a weird little coversation that has comments buried in it somewhere. Keyword Usually. I'm going to go in order of age oldest to youngest, age being when they became one of the people in the mindspace (not sure if this should be capitalized...oh and just so you know, my/the mindspace is pretty much a blank canvas...there's a white, smooth floor of indeterminate substance {unless someone decides what it is, or changes the color, or wants hills} and light everywhere, but the walls and ceiling don't seem to exist until someone says where they are. Oh bedrooms, and doors, and curtains and things show up sometimes, they're just kind of encorperated into the blankness. I'm working on changing it-I'm not sure that I can. I hope I can...Anyway the mindspace, if I haven't said already, is where everyone interacts. So it'll come up quite a bit.) Um...where was I? *scrolls up* So hard to keep track...ah! I was listing the people in order of mindspace age. I'll just put all their stats. If you can think of something else you want to ask, send it to me email or in a review. I'm so desperate for contact/a life that I'll answer any and all questions. If I get enough...I'll make it into a fic, and make it a contest to see who can ask the question that none of us will answer...*grins* That should be interesting...anyway s'pose I should get to the stats for the poor authors that are JUST trying to figure out my review...</p><p>Name:Alex (this is an alias. Yes I AM a girl, if you were wondering.)<br/>Age:15 (*sings* I am fifteen, going on sixteen, ecentric in the extreeme...*stops* random quoting, the family illness! *grins*)<br/>Description:brown eyes, brown wavy hair down to waist, glasses, 5'5". Usually dressed in comfy jeans sometimes with holes in the knees and comfy t-shirts.<br/>Occupation:Student, trying to remember to get off her lazy ass, stop reading fanfics and getting a job; inside mindspace job is fangirl, hentai, being the resident hyper and crazy-acting person (anybody got a name for the post?) and writer/Authoress. Two different things, if you really want an explination, then send me an email. I love mail :D<br/>Dispositon:Usually happy, hyper, sometimes goes insane.<br/>Sign:None (this is in case I suddenly stop writing names. This is also what I use in IMs and so on because usually the person has been told these beforehand. If you don't understand now, you might when you get to Michiko's sign.)</p><p>Name:Michiko<br/>Age:Varies; usually about 18-20 (this varies because waaay back when she was still a character I wrote about, I wrote her in different parts of her personal timeline, so I sort of see her over a lifetime, though parts are missing-ages she never becomes. She is 18-20 usually, because that makes her older than everyone else in here, and makes her job easier because of the...whatchamicalit. I understand it, I'm just at a loss for words...I'll figure it out later I guess.)<br/>Description:Brilliant green eyes, long brown wavy hair(a lot like mine, just not as long. At one point she cut it, at another it was(is? will be? gaah. I need that book that that one dude wrote. I am SO going to edit this later...) longer than mine is now...so it's just whatever she wants it to be. Usually about halfway down her back. (It ALWAYS stays out of her way without looking like it is. I don't know how she does it-but I want whatever it is so that I can wear mine down...) Usually about 6'5". Probably is actually shorter, there isn't any measuring tapes in the mindspace and she looks about a foot taller than me when I look up at her. All you need to know is that she's taller than me, most likely. Has brown cat-ears on the top of her head that match her hair, and a cat-tail to match them. (you oughta know where that goes...it's only logical.) Also has these HUUUUGE white wings coming from her back between her shoulderblades. Has been proven she can use them for flight...and wrap at least one other person in them. Or wrap them all the way around herself 'till all you can see is feathers, but that hurts so she doesn't really do it. (I just realized that maybe...3-5 inches of that foot taller is most likely ears. So she's more like maybe...6'.) She's usually wearing a tight lace-up leather shirt (NO idea how she gets into that thing with the wings...), a lighter brown than her hair, and tight leather pants that match, without any lace-up. Sometimes also is seen wearing green or blue velvet. Oh I almost forgot...she has a mix of predatory and omnivorous teeth, so her teeth look mostly like ours...with niiice long canines. Manages to not look like a vampire however. Also owns a set of wicked retractable claws. (Oh yeah, I am SO doing editing this later...I just scrolled back up to find out what was next on the list...)<br/>Occupation:In Charge. Also known as Being Bossy and Keeping Things Under Control. (It's a hard job...I respect her for it...sometimes ^_^) Also Alex's Keeper when she's in fangirl mode. (I'm writing a fic to explain the Keeper stuff...look for it sometime this summer if Michiko pokes me enough.) Muse (not in the traditional inspiration sense, I get that from EVERYTHING-except her. It's really weird. Instead I talk to her about plots and she helps me hammer out little details BY talking to her, and she reminds me to write, and she {everybody does this, actually, nowadays} talks me through my writers' block. Also checks my spelling and grammar. All of this stuff that pertains to writing that she does I kinda group under Muse. By the way, this job I first started for her so that she'd get out of my hair...that was back when it was just her and me and no mindspace, just her trying to take over and whining and telling me what to do 'cuze she had nobody to boss around, and she kinda needs somebody to take care of, y'know?) If I've forgotten one of her jobs I'll post it later.<br/>Dispositon:Very Alpha(dominating). Seems uptight, but can party with the best of them when she wants to. (I think she has all of the self-control I never had...)<br/>Sign:~ (okay I figured out how to explain it...okay if Michiko is doing something or saying something, it's in those things. If I'M doing something or saying something, it's in nothing. WHEE! So editing after this. I think that's the third time I've said that. Gotta edit that out. GAAH!)</p><p>Name:Lokiana<br/>Age:Indeterminate.<br/>Description:She's a 3-9 tailed kitsune. (It varies...I'm not very clear on kitsune lore, but I think that might be due to her being in different parts of her personal timeline as well.) If you don't know what a kitsune is, it's a Japanese trickster spirit that usually has the form of a fox with a multiple number of tails. As I understand it, the more tails a kitsune has, the more powerful it is. She often looks like a cartoon or Anime figure.<br/>Occupation:Michiko's familiar. Isn't often around on her own, will show up if mentioned in conversation to wreak havoc however. She doesn't really like being tied down, and I don't think she understood what being a familiar meant when she became Michiko's. (The really sad thing is I had about half of the story of her becoming Michiko's familiar and it was the best I've written yet with beautiful description...and it got thrown away when I accidentally left it in a classroom after classes. See it was in a notebook that both of the covers had fell off of, so it looked like crap...I have never used a spiral for my stories again. At least I learned my lesson...but my story is still gone, dammit. I'm done ranting now.)<br/>Dispositon:Hyper, likes to play tricks, talks a lot. (I have the feeling if she comes back sometime soon she'll get along smashingly with Duo...and together they shall make the mindspace a shambles. That'll be fun to watch :D)<br/>Sign:~()~(Since she isn't around much, she doesn't get her own seperate sign. She's in parentheses inside Michiko's sign, and it should be obvious when it's her and not Michiko saying something in parentheses.)</p><p>Name:Duo (He's not exactly like he is on Gundam Wing...but mostly the same. Living in the mindspace has affected him, I think.)<br/>Age:15 or 16<br/>Description:Seems to be about 5'7" from my point of veiw. Looks almost exactly the same as on Gundam Wing only his eyes are a heck of a lot more purple, instead of just the tint of purple on the show. Isn't completely purple though, it's got a tint of blue. (Musteditmusteditmustedit...) If you haven't seen Gundam Wing you're seriously deprived and I suggest you watch it as soon as possible. He's got long brown hair, lighter than mine and a bit darker than Michiko's leather. It's always back in a braid that reaches to his tailbone, though if you're lucky you might see him brushing it out...he also has bangs. For those people who have seen GW, he's not wearing what he usually does.('cept once for some reason he was wearing the cap...) Instead he has this really shibby black shirt that I can't describe that's silk, and these incredibly tight black pants...*starts spacing, starts drooling...realizes she actually has something to do, shakes out of it* Er, sorry...Where was I?<br/>Occupation:Gl</p></div></td></tr></table> <style>
