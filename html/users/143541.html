Check them out! Pweease, with sugar on top?? Oh fine, damn it, I'll add the cherry!!</p><p>UPDATES:</p><p>10/17/02</p><p>For some odd reason, I decided to post here today (even though I don't use this site anymore). Eminem's birthday is TODAY! (Go to my journal to read more about it all.)I swear I'll have something up (some kind of chapter or whatnot- this has really been a very bad year (new school year) for me). Bare with me, I'm having family problems (they aren't massive or anything on any kind of scale- they just can't relate to me, and the sad part is, that I WANT them to... but they don't)and the friend issue is better left unsaid- I have a few "good" ones, but the thing is, I don't WANT them. I want to be left alone. How sad and baby-fuckin'-whining is that? This is starting to sound like my journal. I'm going to try to get my stories up on  (my site), but that might take a while.</p><p>Cya</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>9/26/02</p><p>I'm still trying to get the word out to everyone on the soupfiction.net and fandomination.net websites.</p><p>9/20/02</p><p>EVERYONE GO TO SOUPFICTION.NET or FANDOMINATION.NET!!! THEY DON'T DISCRIMINATE!!!</p><p>And check out  to find out more about what is going on. I'll be posting all my new fics at both soupfiction.net and fandomination.net and I sent out mass emails to damn near everyone about this! Email me at mudgurl647@yahoo.com and join my update group for more information. Sorry everyone, no updates today. Hell- I just remembered it's Friday- I've been so busy freaking out about THIS damn website.</p><p>"Unleash your soul" my ASS... more like GIVE YOUR SOUP FREEDOM AND THEN TAKE THAT FREEDOM AWAY AND INSLAVE AND TORTURE THE SOULS BY TAKING AWAY THEIR ONLY MEANS OF LIFE!!</p><p>9/12/02</p><p>Oh god... I can't believe fanfiction.net would do this to us. Take away MUSIC FAN-FICTION! PLEASE SOMEONE Email ME ASAP, IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER SITE WE CAN ALL POST AT!!</p><p>Go to:</p><p></p><p>To get a link to save the music groups!</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>9/7/02</p><p>THANXZ TO FF.NET!! They fixed the little uploading error or whatever happened with my story. So NOW you can go check it out. ;) Cya,</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>9/6/02</p><p>SURPRIZE!!!</p><p>New story! It's a real short story and considered a "blurb" in my book. It's called "Death Becomes Him" and is a just Justin story. Kinda. Rated PG-13 for... well... nothing really. Cause it sounds better than PG? There's no slash in it, but trust me- it's so short, there was no time to put slash. I was really bored when I came up with it, and it's not up to "my usual standard" at all- but read if you feel like! Enjoy!</p><p>Cya</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>P.S.</p><p>Everyone, I don't know what's wrong with the story, but I'm gonna try to fix it. For now, when the disclaimer comes up- just type "chapter2" after the URL (DON'T ERASE ANYTHING!) and the story should come up. If not, email me or review and I'll keep trying to fix it!</p><p>Till then, this link might help:</p><p>http://www.fanfiction.net/read.php?storyid=953999&amp;chapter=2</p><p>9/5/02</p><p>Since support service cost dropped (by a few dollers only though) and it's now $36.00 for a whole year instead of $40, I might get the whole year thing. I mean, I did spend $200 on a cab to Tampa- (read about it in my livejournal)- so I feel like splurging. I have until 9/26 to make up my mind.</p><p>Cya</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>P.S.</p><p>I just now configured my email to my yahoo.com address. This means that you can send and email to: "mudgurl647@fanfiction.net" and I'll get it. So, if you forget "yahoo.com", just put "fanfiction.net".</p><p>8/29/02</p><p>Ok, I feel like being nice and uploaded Chapter 10: Please of UYC today instead of tommorrow (on account of the fact that tommorrow is going to be CrAzY for me). Since I have support, if you add me to your fav.'s list, you'll get updates from me- with or without yourself having the service!! Yey!!</p><p>Cya</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>P.S.</p><p>I'm thinking about posting a new story- while still working on BFW and UYC. Maybe a short story or so. I have a bunch of different stories I'm working on right now, one being a Justin story (sorry, no slash), but it'll be cool and something to hold 'yall over. Don't expect it out until at least two+ weeks.</p><p>8/25/02</p><p>Hey- alright. I decided to be very generous to fanfiction.net (I figure they need the money to keep us all going) and donated $6.00 for the one month support. So, you get to see my very blurry but interesting permit photo (like the one in my livejournal) for 30 days. Enjoy. LoL.</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>8/23/02</p><p>Hey everybody! Guess what? I updated! Cause todayzzzzz Friday!</p><p>I just added the next chapter (CHAPTER 9) of UYC (Lance/JC)!</p><p>And I am SOOOO tired. Cya everyone, and remember to read and review!</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>P.S. I am so sorry to the people whom I haven't reviewed yet(in<br/>thanxz for reviewing my own work). The thing is, there are two<br/>problems with that.</p><p>#1 Is that the computer I'm on doesn't let me have any pop ups and I can't figure out why but when they try to come up (it's not a stopper) they get mangeled and AOL tries to interfere.</p><p>And #2 fanfiction.net lost 5 or 6 reviews from various stories(most from UYC) and they were gone the next time I tried to review! Don't worry- I'll figure something out. Until then- A BIG SORRY!!</p><p>8/18/02</p><p>Hey everyone. Thanxz so much for your advice on BFW. I really wrote the whole thing in one sitting, minutes before I posted it... that's probably why it wasn't up to my standard. I was a little unhappy with it too, but hey- I had to put something out. Thanxz for everyone's help!</p><p>Oh, and another thing, I'm at a weird computer and it's not letting me review all of 'yall's stories. I usually go and read all the reviews I got, and then review one of each reviewer's stories and leave something helpful (or not, I don't know...I try), right away... so don't get all "she's not doing it anymore!!" cause I will ASAP.</p><p>Next Friday is gonna be a chapter of UYC and I really gotta get back on track cause I don't have the slightest idea of where that story's going.</p><p>Cya</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>8/16/02</p><p>IZZZZZZZZZZZZZ FRRRRRRRRRRRIDAY!!</p><p>And guess what that means? Update of BFW!! I've been feeling so guilty about not writing more for that damn thing that I went and wrote all last night to update it. The story is suppose to be realitivly short, but it might be about the length of The Creature Within, with longer chapters.</p><p>Cya</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>8/10/02</p><p>I am so sorry 'yall! I can't update because the mouse on my computer is broken now (I bought a new mouse but it's the program on my computer that's messed up) so it's BACK with the company. This is aggrivating me too. I'm using my sister's computer (sadly, my account doesn't have any new chapters uploaded on it) to type this out to everyone! Sorry! Between fanfiction.net screw ups and my computer problems, I haven't gonna ANYTHING done this summer, have I? I did brainstorm more ideas for UYC and got about half a chapter handwritten today, if that makes up for anything. I'll get my computer back on Wed. and type up the *fully written* next chapter for Fri. I need to get back on track, no? School is starting again and I'm gonna get back to work!</p><p>Thanxz for everyone's patience,</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>8/2/02</p><p>So, I just updated Underneath Your Clothes to chapter #8. Sorry that it's not BMW! I'm gonna try to get that for next week because I've been so busy with school and all and then I kinda had a UYC brainstorm. Go check out *ungood* (chapter 8) and have a *goodgood* time doing it! (Just read it, you'll get it).</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>7/31/02</p><p>Hey everyone! I'm so happy cause I got my laptop back and now I can post, cause it...works! I know, I know, I've been badly neglecting "Boys Fight World" but I need some time to mentally sort that one out. Plus, I don't have any chapters "mentally prewritten", so that makes it a lot harder. But, never fear! I will work on BFW for the next few weeks and try to pump out some chapters.</p><p>Cya</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>7/29/02</p><p>Fire of the Vampire &amp; Other Readers-</p><p>To answer your questions, I wrote you a personal email, but also thought that a response is worthy here. Just in case any other readers are wondering the same things as you.</p><p>#1) Was that Lance who came into the room, or Britney?</p><p>Answer: It was indeed Lance that came into the room (at least, that's who I had in mind, hence the word "baby") but I see how you could have viewed it as her.</p><p>#2) Is Lance dead?</p><p>Answer: Because of above, Lance would not be dead, in body. In spirit and mind, I'd say so. Justin's dead, and Justin and him were lovers, of course.</p><p>#3) Did Justin just dream it all?</p><p>Answer: Does seem pretty unrealistic to be "possessed", huh? If you're going for realism, Justin would have dreamed it, but if not... (Cont. in #4)</p><p>#4) Did the Madam possess him to kill everyone but Lance?</p><p>Answer: Yes, if you want an unrealistic story.</p><p>In other words, personally, I would choose the latter, simply because I like supernatural.</p><p>But you (any reader) want to view something more realistic, then believe what you wish, which could very well be that Justin dreamed it or Lance dreamed it or whatnot.</p><p>As with anything in writing, you can never really get a straight answer, and I am sorry if you are still confused. Please email me at mudgurl647@yahoo.com for any further questions.</p><p>I'm not keen on a sequel to this story (sorry for those of you who wanted one), but will try to have more like it asap. Thanxz everyone for being with me for a great story, and I hope to have more out like this soon.</p><p>Cya,</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>7/24/02</p><p>Fixed the disclaimer of The Creature Within to show that the story is finished. Sent an email out to some people about questions they had about The Creature Within. Still haven't gotten back my laptop, so I don't think I'm gonna make the update on Friday. So sorry! G2G (on school computer). Bye!</p><p>Cya</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>7/22/02</p><p>I am so frusterated. My computer (laptop) isn't working. I press the button, it makes noise, the screen stays dead. Does anyone know how to work Transports?? I've tried taken the battery and A drive out and dusting it out with computer cleaner duster thing; i've tried adjusting the light/dark settings on the screen' I've tried shutting it down and waiting and restarting, re-charging the battery, and done all of those with both the battery out and battery in and plugged into the wall with the cord. This thing is not working at all. My dad's taking it into the office so their computer tech/person can look at it (a.k.a my uncle). I hope I get it back sooner then Thurs. so I can double and get something out, but if I only get it back Thurs. or Fri., then I can't make the Friday deadline and I'll try for next Friday to update multiples.</p><p>If not, sorry. Summerschool takes up 8-2, tutoring (math) from 2-3, arobics (at home w/ instructor) from 3:30-4:30, piano from 4:30-5:30, then homework from 5:30-6:30 (adv. comp and math), and we eat dinner around 6:30-7:00. So from 8am to 7pm I don't get a brake. Do you know how hard it is to write after a dull day like that? Lol, I'm serious. And my bedtime (stop laughing) is at 9 because of school. So I got two hours in which I stare at my computer, come online and get my email checked, ebay checked, 2 yahoo groups updated and checked, and ff.net checked (and reading stories from reviewers like I've promised) Then it's 8 and I do a little more homework due to writer's block. Then I have 30 mins staring at my 'puter, and 30 to yell, scream, wear myself out, and then go to bed. What a life, huh? Lol, but I don't want pity. Just cut me a lil lee-way if I don't update this week. Cya!</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>7/19/02</p><p>Today is FRIDAY!!! And guess what? I just uploaded the FINAL CHAPTER of The Creature Within! Which means it's FINISHED!!! Everyone go read it! Yeah!! Lol. I'll work on getting out more next Friday, but ff.net has gotta work too. Cya everyone!</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>Later on the 10th:</p><p>Managed to update UYC (CHAPTER 7 IS NOW UP!!), but I haven't been<br/>able to upload the last (as in final, done!) chapter of The Creature Within because the dang document manager is down.</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>07-10-02</p><p>YES!!! Finally ff.net is back up. SO much has happened since before. I started a NEW YAHOO group, and by joining, you can get updates of all my stories! And, I'm going to try to post the stories in the "files" section, so that if ff.net is ever down again, everyone can still access them. The yahoo group is simply called "mudgurl647" and i'll only be updating if I have an important message or an update (no spam from me, lol) and one more thing: I won't be posting the actual stories (or chapters) IN the updates (like some groups do- it drives me crazy, esp. if I join halfway into a story). They will be in the club page, so that you may access them whenever you like, on your own time. I'm going to get the addy and put it on here in a moment, and then I'll work on getting yall some chapters up. Cya!</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>06-27-02</p><p>Nobody read the new chapter yet? Of UYC? Lol, ok everyone, I'll have something out before I leave for the beach on Saturday. But review for UYC before then! Remember, you review one of mine, I review one of yours!</p><p>06-23-02</p><p>Ok, something weird happened and erased my updates from Saturday. Let me go put them back up and please, if you reviewed, review again! (Sorry, thanxz) I had put up CHAPTER 6 of UYC and am working on a few other things to put up on account of ff.net being down and out. Plus, I had added the URL (look above) to a new website which I am being hosted on (just the Joshtin stuff) and Waiting is up there. Check there if ff.net is down again. Thanxz everyone!</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>06-13-02</p><p>I might be going out of town to a beach house the 24th through the 6th but I'm not sure yet. The bummer thing is, we're going to a beach house without a computer. My laptop doesn't get internet access... *bummer, i know. But- never fear! For I will update every Friday before we leave, and will write like crazy at the house... so let's all hope for a *mondo* update when I get back. Next chapter of UYC will be up tommorrow. Cya,</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>06-07-02</p><p>Today I was asked these questions:</p><p>TigerX's post:</p><p>hey that was cool. only two things: why are you leaving so much space between the lines? or is that just how the upload turned up. #2: are they supposed to be gay or something? no offense if you're not trying to make them gay. anyway that was good. really? your gonna review mine? ok... "The Friends Who Were" BMW fic<br/>-TigerX</p><p>My response:</p><p>#1: I am leaving more than the normal amount of space in between the lines so that the reading of the story will be easier- it drives me crazy when a story is all clumped up together, esp. when mine were :)</p><p>#2: In the summery, I have:</p><p>SLASH DRAMA* Cory and Shawn struggle with life. What happens when they discover what was there all along? YOU review one of MINE and I'LL review one of YOURS!! CHAPTER 1 UP NOW!!!</p><p>The term "slash" means that the story involves some kind of sexual feelings, relationships, or actions between people of the same sex.</p><p>In other words, yes, there will be a sexual feeling/relationship/action in the story. And because the story's two main characters are Cory and Shawn (I wouldn't have bothered stating "slash" unless it was a major part of the story), and it is hinted in the summery, that shouldn't be surprising.</p><p>I hope that clears everything up.</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>Decided to put it here in case anyone had the same questions they were wondering. Plus, I just want everyone to know that when I say that I will review one of your stories, I don't mean for everyone to request a story. I am loyal to my word and will review one of your stories (IF YOU ARE SIGNED IN- if not there's no garantee, but i'll try to find you and if you actually have stories up) But please- I'm giving up my time to go back and review a story for yall- at least give me the choice of which one. I'm not mad at anyone, I just want you to think about that before telling me which story to review. Thanxz everyone. Cya.</p><p>Earlier today...</p><p>Just updated Boys Fight World... and it's interesting- a little funny and a little dramatic. I hope it sounds like the characters. Just checked it and noticed it's about twice the size of my normal chapters. Don't know if this will be a pattern or not. I just stop when I think the chapter has a complete idea, not noticing how long it is. Read and review!</p><p>06-06-02</p><p>EVERYBODY WATCH EMINEM ON MTV 2002 AWARDS @ 9:00 PM TONIGHT!!!</p><p>(Sorry- I'm Em crazy)</p><p>06-04-02</p><p>I am almost done with the first chapter of Boys Fight World and that will come out Friday. The reason I'm waiting a few "update dates" for The Creature Within is because I want everyone to have a chance to read and review it before the final chapter comes out. Plus, I just updated it, so it can wait a bit. :)</p><p>06-02-02</p><p>I was thinking I update Boy Fights World this Friday, because I only have a little bit of that going. I'll hold off on UYC until the next Friday. TCW will be the Friday after. All depends on the time I have and reviews I get.But hey, an update every week on one of my stories isn't that bad, right?</p><p>05-31-02</p><p>SCHOOL IS OVER!!! YEAH!!! (for me anyways) So, I just uploaded the</p><p>CHAPTER #6 of THE CREATURE WITHIN!!!</p><p>Yeah!! Read and review everyone! The faster I will write the more reviews I get! (*Motivation*)</p><p>05-29-02</p><p>So... FRIDAY is almost here! Two days! And I'm posting what is going to be the SECOND TO LAST chapter of The Creature Within! That's right, folks! Only TWO chapters left and one of them will be posted on FRIDAY! Check back then!</p><p>05-27-02</p><p>Thanxz to NSUCK for posting a review to chapter 5 of UYC. How does everyone like the stories so far? I know we all have finals coming up, so I'm not gonna beg for reviews right now. But hey, if ya have a little time *hint hint*. Next Friday I'm gonna give you the next chapter (chapter 6) of The Creature Within. Get ready for it! Countdown begins now: 4 days and counting...</p><p>05-25-02</p><p>Did a little needed mainance on UYC and updated the chapters list, put double spacing chapters 3, 4, and 5 for better viewing. Now I'm gonna work on The Creature Within mainance and check the others (Waiting and Boys Fight World) for any probs. Email me at mudgurl647@yahoo.com for any comments or suggestions.</p><p>P.S. I'm working on starting a few new stories, but not until The Creature Within is complete and I've gotten farther in the other UYC and BFW. I'll have a poll later on witch story you guys will wanna see.</p><p>Just did work on Waiting and changed the chapters list. Plus I upped the rating to PG-13 because of the second part.</p><p>Back. Just did a little The Creature Within clean-up and worked a little more on Waiting. Hopefully they look a little better. BFW is fine, I checked it.</p><p>05-24-02</p><p>Iz FRRRRRRRRRIIIDAY!!</p><p>Update day. I just put up the next chapter of UYC!!! CHAPTER 5 everyone!</p><p>Read and review!!</p><p>And I'm gonna work on replacing the chapters 3-5 on UYC with double spaced chapters to help the viewing (it bugs me when they're crammed). If you see one of those chapters down- don't freak! Just wait about 5 min and it'll be back up and better.</p><p>Cya</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>05-22-02</p><p>Hey ff.net crew and associates! My next chapter of UYC will be out this FRIDAY for sure. And FRIDAY is going to be my offical update day. Unless there are any other "incidents" that come up, ALL UPDATES WILL NOW BE ON FRIDAYS. Just to let everyone know. So, if you can only get the computer one night, try fri or sat when you know a new story or chapter will be up. Thanxz and goodbye.</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>05-20-02</p><p>Hey all. I'm at my friend's house and wrote a little, but because I didn't have the disk to upload the next UYC chapter (grrrr...i'm REALLY sorry everyone) I was inspired by a show that was on (which I love) and decided to write a little Boy Meets World slash. I've always thought that show was extremely slashable (Cory/Shawn and Eric/Jack are the most workable pairings in my opinion)and I check out the BMW section of FF.net as was more than a little dissapointed (*sniffs* oh well) so wrote a little prologue to a story. The title is Boys Fight World and is very subjectable to change (I don't like the title) and is rated PG-13 as of now. Later on, I might up the rating, but I have no idea where this story is going, and it's hard enough to write a TV Show fanfic (because it's like writing an episode of the show), so don't expect this one to be updated any time soon. Thanxz for reading everyone, and drive home saftly.</p><p>Cya</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>05-19-02</p><p>Thanxz for the reviews everyone! I'm still working on getting my computer fixed, but the next chapter of UYC is done! So all I have to do is upload it. Except this computer (the one at school) doesn't let you do that, so I'm going to have to get my computer fixed asap or go to a friend's house or something. I managed to write the next chapter of Underneith Your Clothes, cause I know it's been almost a month since I last updated it and I'm so SO sorry! School is catching up on me... after exams, I will be back on track and updating every other week or every week. Bare with me! Thanxz everyone.</p><p>cya,</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>05-11-02</p><p>As FF.net would say... SUCCESS!! I uploaded a NEW chapter of THE CREATURE WITHIN!!! CHAPTER #5- One By One They Steal My Sanity! READ AND REVIEW!!</p><p>I still haven't gotten my computer fixed (I'm at a friend's house) but I will put it the next chapter of UYC up by the end of May (hopefully). Thanxz yall!!</p><p>P.S. Sorry for such a short chapter- the last two (yes, we are nearing the end) will be longer! Cya!</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>05-08-02</p><p>My computer is busted! I am SO pissed off right now, you can't even imagine. So I can't write the next chapter. Right now I'm on the school computer and have a few paragraphs of The Creature Within, but help!! I have to leave in a few min. and don't have time to write the rest! I'll put the next chapter up as soon as my computer is fixed. I told my mom and she is gonna call the computer person tommorrow, so don't expect the next chapter out Friday. I am so sorry you guys. I'll post it as soon as I can, definatly before the end of May.</p><p>Thanxz,</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>05-04-02</p><p>I went and saw the movie Spiderman today- and loved it. Was a little too mushy and not enough action for my taste (ironic, cause I write a lot of fluff), but it's GOOD! Everyone go see it! Next week, you can look forward to...another chapter of The Creature Within! (Most likely next Friday). So, check back then! And read and review!!</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>05-02-02</p><p>Because of a special request, I added another part of "Waiting" (Justin's pov) and I personally don't like it, but hey- I write for yall. I take requests openly. R/R please.</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>04-30-02</p><p>Hey everyone again! I checked back and four people review (different people) so the next chapter won't come out tommorrow, but five reviews tommorw and it'll come out on Thursday! Thanxz for reviewing everyone!</p><p>04-30-02</p><p>Hey everyone! Thanxz for the reviews! I just went and uploaded the next chapter of the josh/lance story. Hear that? CHAPTER 4 OF UNDERNEATH YOUR CLOTHES IS NOW UP!!! Go check it out. And read/ review and remember...</p><p>IF I GET 5+ REVIEWS FROM DIFFERENT REVIEWERS TODAY, I'LL PUT A CHAPTER OUT TOMMORROW (OR THE NEXT DAY)!!</p><p>Cya</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>04-26-02</p><p>Hey everyone. I'm gonna go put out another chapter of THE CREATURE WITHIN- CHAPTER #4, and try to put out a new chapter (starting now) every other friday (exams), then more often in the summer. Thanxz and read and review (PLEASE!!)</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>04-24-02</p><p>Hey everyone! Wanted to say it was my birthday yesterday! Yep. So...my best friend and cousin is coming down from the shivery up north to visit little ol' ME for my bday, and go to a concert (Earthday Birthday!!), so I might put out a chapter on Friday to make up for my lack of writing this weekend...but only if I get a few more reviews!! LOL. Just kidding, you know I love 'yall, even if you don't read and review. But it would be REALLY REALLY nice! :)</p><p>Cya</p><p>Mudgurl647</p><p>04-22-02</p><p>Hey everyone. Guess what? In honor of my birthday (which it actually tommorrow) I decided to upload another chapter of a story. NEW CHAPTER OF THE CREATURE WITHIN!!! CHAPTER # 3! Yall owe me, cause I wasn't going to put it out until this weekend. But, if I get really good reviews, I could put another chapter out sometimes this week! *hint hint* SO PLEASE READ AND REVIEW!! Thanxz!!!</p><p>04-20-02</p><p>I feel bad cause this ain't really an update. But, I need to know if anyone would like to host my fiction on their site until I get my own site going. I repeat:</p><p>IF YOU LIKE MY WRITING, AND WOULD LIKE TO HOST IT ON YOUR NSYNC SLASH SITE (or het site, but don't mind slash) PLEASE EMAIL ME AT MUDGURL647@YAHOO.COM.</p><p>Thanxz so much, y'all.</p><p>04-19-02</p><p>Yall, when I said 5 reviews, that means 5 by different people. If one person just reviews it 5 times (not naming any names), I would be up forever writing. Thanxz for all the praise, though. As for "borrowing" my stuff, well a peice or two is fine if you TELL me before hand and give me appropriate credit (I will tell you what I need you to put in your disclaimer so that you may use my writing) and thanxz for the person who asked me (again not naming any names). And I'll have a new chapter out maybe next week sometimes. Kay? That it? Good yall :)</p><p>04-18-02</p><p>Hey guys! I UPDATED!! UNDERNEATH YOUR CLOTHES has a new chapter! CHAPTER 3!! So go check it out! Read and review please!!!</p><p>04-17-02</p><p>Not an update but I gotta tell yall this. I really love feedback on my stories; it really helps in my writing. Tips and suggestions and constructive comments really speed up my writing (makes me write instead of doing my homework- not always a good thing :), but ff.net is worth it!)</p><p>FOR EVERY FIVE REVIEWS I GET, I'LL PUT OUT A CHAPTER THE NEXT DAY!!</p><p>04-13-02</p><p>NEW CHAPTER OF THE CREATURE WITHIN!! This chapter may seem a little, eh, a little cheesy and a little boring but it's gonna get alot better, I promise! Just bare with me and I'm gonna give you a great horror fic! *smiles sadistically* just wait till they get to the cabin (its gonna be the chapter after the next where everything starts picking up!</p><p>And...thanxz everyone for the terrific reviews. And I'm working on my spelling (as was mentioned in one review), and hope the newer chapters will be better formatting. Thanxz and cya.</p><p>04-07-02</p><p>OK, so it took a while, but I got the damn thing up. Go check it out!</p><p>I'm back a little earlier than I thought! So...as I promised, I will upload something *new*.</p><p>What I am going to go upload in a few seconds will be the start of a mystery/horror story. Itz a slash (Justin/Lance- cause I like a little Nsync varity) and will be a little tame in the beginning but *dun dun dun* is gonna get- icky. I've never used that word before. Woah. That was my first time using the word "icky". Ok, well, maybe "icky" isn't the word. See, I don't want to go discribe it as "horrifing" or "discusting" because it might not be to some people. But, it is even a little to myself. So just, be aware that towards the end, this story is going to get a little werid. It's not so much mystery as it is horror, and I would tell you more, but I don't want to give anything (my ideas which are bubbling) away. So, check out the story "The Creature Within" and read/review. Thanxz!</p><p>Oh, and thanxz for the wonderful reveiws 'yall! You guys are great. I know how *painsaking* it is to give a story, even a really good story, a reveiw, so I really appriciate it. Thanxz!!</p><p>03-28-02</p><p>Sorry, not an update but I'm gonna be out of town March/April 29-8 but when i get back, i'll put up</p><p>A) another chapter (#3) of "Underneath Your Clothes"</p><p>and/or</p><p>B) a short story or new chapter story (the mystery/horror slash story I'm working on)</p><p>03-15-02</p><p>NEW CHAPTER OF UNDERNEATH YOUR CLOTHES!!!</p><p>CHAPTER 2 CALLED: I KNOW YOU!!!</p><p>Ok, don't expect another update for about a week or so because I have a LOT of work to do (hey, if you r/r, maybe i'll put off my homework ~sigh~ *poor grades*)but I will work on the new mystery story and maybe you will get a chapter of that in a weak.</p><p>And possibly another Underneath Your Clothes update (chapter 3) in two and 1/2 to three weaks. Could be a little sooner (depending on how much my reveiwers want it!)</p><p>I kept my update promise everyone!</p><p>Oh, and a shout out to SlasherFire aka Star Knight (lol...sorry *winks*).</p><p>03-11-02</p><p>Sorry, not really an update but I'm gonna be out of town March 12-16, so don't expect any updates but *swears on her life* when i get back, i'll put up</p><p>A) another chapter (#2) of "Underneath Your Clothes"</p><p>and/or</p><p>B) possible (as in maybe) sequel and/or justin's pov for "Waiting"</p><p>and/or</p><p>C) a short story or new chapter story (prob. a three to five chapter short story)</p><p>NOTE: I'm thinking about writing a MYSTERY/HORROR story... a SHORT one (new at that writing; i usually write romance) but it will have a justin/lance pairing for me to fall back on (in case the story blows)! BYE!</p><p>03-09-02</p><p>NEW story up!! It's called Waiting. It's a short little smurf about Justin and JC (JC's POV). Itz a *slash* and a little bit of *angst* and a lot of *poor jacey*.</p><p>03-05-02</p><p>NEW chapter up for Underneath Your Clothes! Chapter 1! TOLD you it would get better (lol). I just had to get the prologe (HOW do you spell THAT?!?) out of the way and now *drumroll please* ... the FUN stuff! Here we go...</p><p>03-03-02</p><p>I finally put a story up! Yay for me! Lol. This story is titled after the song "Underneath Your Clothes" by Shakira. (I LOVE that song!) Also,this story is *slash* joshua/james and jc/lance. You'll get the picture when I start uploading new chapters. It might seem kinda *formal* at first but don't 'yall worry, it gets a LOT better (with some nice juicy smut too *romantic smut*). Read and review peeps, it speeds me up!</p></div></td></tr></table> <style>
