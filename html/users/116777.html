Lews Therin Telamon (The Path of Daggers).<br/>"Is there a flame that won't be quenched by water or wind? Is there a mountain that won't be crumbled by the wind and water?" Aes Sedai sayings (The Eye of the World).<br/>"I'm the one that's supposed to go mad, Aes Sedai, but you already are." Rand, to Cadsuane (Winter's Heart).<br/>"Rand is the one that's supposed to go mad, but here I am, talking to an axe!" Perrin, to his axe (The Shadow Rising).<br/>"Rand, you woolhead!" Min.<br/>"Bad habits pay off in the long run." Mat (The Dragon Reborn).<br/>"It's time to toss the dice." Mat (The Fires of Heaven).<br/>"I killed the whole world, and you can too, if you try hard." Lews Therin Telamon (The Path of Daggers).<br/>"Dancing is sweeter on the edge of a sword." Saying in Arafel (The Great Hunt).<br/>"It's not the stone you see that trips yoo on your face." Lini (The Path of Daggers).<br/>"The Dragon Reborn is a man, Morr, and like all men, he is sulking because he thinks a woman doesn't want to see him anymore." Min (The Path of Daggers).<br/>"Not yet." Rand, not going insane, yet (The Path of Daggers).<br/>"On the heights, the paths are paved with daggers." Saying in Seanchan (The Path of Daggers).<br/>"An Aes Sedai never lies, but the truth she speaks is not always the truth you think you hear." Saying concerning Aes Sedai (The Eye of the World).<br/>"Whether the wolf beats the bear, or the bear beats the wolf, the rabbit always looses." Saying in the Two Rivers (The Eye of the World).<br/>"The only constant in the man was his constant desire to kill, which sometimes included himself." Rand's thoughts on Lews Therin Telamon (The Path of Daggers).<br/>"A young man chases shadows and runs from moonlight, and in the end he stabs himself in the foot with his own spear." Bael, an Aiel clan-chief (Lord of Chaos).<br/>"Rand al'Thor...is a mule-headed, stonewilled, fool of a...a...a man!" Moiraine Damodred (The Shadow Rising).<br/>"Bring your lightnings, Aes Sedai.

Elyas (The Path of Daggers).<br/>"Winter is coming." Eddard Stark (A Game of Thrones).<br/>"A storm is coming." Nyneave al'Meara (Lord of Chaos).<br/>"If it hurts too much, make it hurt someone else instead." Lews Therin Telamon (The Path of Daggers).<br/>"Men think with the hair on their chests." Nyneave al'Maera.<br/>"Light, sometimes it seemed the knowing what was in a man’s head made the confusion worse!"

(Crossroads of Twilight).<br/>"Leonin should not have been able to hear a word, but he could feel Meidani’s mood, of course, and he moved a step farther away. While still keeping watch along the corridor, of course. A good man. A wise man." (Crossroads of Twilight).<br/>"I will start at the beginning, Davram. And go slowly, so you can understand. I returned from my ride to find two strange men ransacking our tent. They drew daggers, so naturally, I hit one of them with a chair and stabbed the other." Deira Bashere (Crossroads of Twilight).<br/>"Why did he [Mat] always find himself bloody lumbered with bloody women who pulled knives on him or tried to kick his head off? It was not fair." (Crossroads of Twilight).<br/>"He [Mat] was not about to be bullied by Setalle Anan or a bosomy lady’s maid or the high and mighty High Lady Daighter of the Nine bloody Moons!" (crossroads of Twilight).<br/>"He [Mat] would not have thought she was the sort to like dangerous men. That kind of woman was worth avoiding; they tended to find ways to make a man need to be dangerous." (Crossroads of Twilight).<br/>"Notions of privacy never kept a Wise One from sticking her nose wherever she wanted. They were like Aes Sedai that way." (Crossroads of Twilight).<br/>"Powerful nobles were like rain or snow, facts of nature to be endured until they went away, but nothing to get flustered over." (Crossroads of Twilight).<br/>"Trust no one, including me." Lews Therin Telamon (Crossroads of Twilight).<br/>"Some said that turnabout was fair play, but she [Cadsuane] had never believed in fighting fair. Either you fought, or you did not, and it was never a game. Fairness was for people standing safely to one side, talking while others bled." (Crossroads of Twilight).<br/>"Why, when a woman offered to help you, did she always start by sticking you in a pot of hot water and stoking up the fire?" Mat Cauthon (Crossroads of Twilight).<br/>"Fortune rides like the sun on high / With the fox that makes the ravens fly / Luck his soul, the lightning his eye, / He snatches the moon from out of the sky." From the Prophesies of the Dragon (Crossroads of Twilight).<br/>"Come to think, women and battles were not that different. Both wrapped a man in fog and could kill him without trying. If he was careless." Mat Cauthon (Crossroads of Twilight).</p><p>From Discworld Novels (By Terry Prachett):<br/>"One of the universal rules of happiness is: never trust a helpful item that weighs less than its operating manual.” (Jingo!).<br/>"The wizard's staff has a knob at the end." Corporal Nobby Nobbs, human.<br/>"It's a certainy, but it just might work." Sargent Fred Colon (Guards! Guards!).<br/>"If you had to chose between the blessings of wealth, beauty, and happiness and being on the good side of Granny Weatherwax, I know which I would chose!" Agness Nitt (Carpe Jugulum).<br/>"Let's just say that if complete and utter chaos were lightning, he'd be the sort to stand on a hilltop wearing wet copper armor and shouting, "All gods are bastards." Rincewind, speaking of Twoflower (The Color of Magic).<br/>"The pen is mightier than the sword, but only if the sword is small and the pen is very, very sharp." (The Light Fantastic).<br/>"Gods play games with the lives of men. They set up the pieces on the board and then look all over the place for the dice." (Soul Music).<br/>"Just because someone is an ethnic minority doesn't mean he's not a selfish, self-centered bastard." Commander Sam Vimes (Feet of Clay).<br/>"Throw the book at him, Carrot." Captain Sam Vimes (Guards! Guards!).<br/>"If six feet of solid oak won't knock it out, it won't be easily killed by magic." Archchancellor Ridcully (Soul Music).<br/>"Much human ingenuity has gone into finding the ultimate Before. The current state of knowledge can be summerized thus: In the beggining there was nothing, which exploded." (Lords and Ladies).<br/>"May you live in interesting times!" Ancient Discworld curse (Interesting Times).<br/>"I can't imagine who'd want to murder opera people... except p'haps other opera people. And p'haps the musicians. And some of the audience, p'haps." Nanny Ogg (Maskerade).<br/>"Sudden death, as they call it." Esme Weatherwax, to DEATH (Masquerade).<br/>"If people wanted to go around teaching people lessons, other people should remember that those people knew a thing or two about people." Nanny Ogg (Maskerade).<br/>"The insouciant moustache, the long sideburns and the tousled black hair combined with the well-developed muscles to give the impression of the more louche kind of buccaneer or a romantic poet who'd given up on the opium and tried red meat instead." (Maskerade).<br/>"You see, it's fine for actors. There's plenty of parts for old men. Acting's something you can do all your life. You get better at it. But when your talent is singing or dancing... Time creeps up behind you all the... time. Time is the poison. You watch backstage one night and you'll see the dancers checking all the time in any mirror they can find for that first little imperfection. You watch the singers. Everyone's on edge, everyone knows that this might be their last perfect night, that tomorrow might be the begining of the end. That's why everyone's worried about luck, you see? All that stuff about live flowers being unlucky, you remember? Well, so's green. And real jewellry worn on stage. And real mirrors on stage. And whistelling on stage. And peeking at the audience through the main curtains. And using new makeup on a first night. And knitting on stage, even at rehersals. A yellow clarinet in the orchestra is very unlucky, don't ask me why. And as for stopping a performance before its proper ending, well, that's the worst luck of all.

(Jingo!)</p><p>From The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series (By Douglass Adams):<br/>"A towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have. You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus-V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bubblatter Beast of Traal (a mind-bogglingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can’t see it, it can’t see you – daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough. More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (non hitchhiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, washcloth, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit, etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitchhiker might have accidentally have “lost.” What a strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the Galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win though and still know where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with." (The Hitchkiker's Guide to the Galaxy)<br/>"The Encyclopedia Galactica defines a robot as a mechanical apparatus designed to do the work of a man. The marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation defines a robot as "Your Plastic Pal Who's Fun to Be With." The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy defines the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as "a bunch of mindless jerks who'll be the first against the wall when the revolution comes," with a footnote to the effect that the editors would welcome applications from anyone interested in taking over the post of robotics correspondent. Curiously enough, an edition of the Encyclopedia Galactica that had the good fortune to fall through a time warp from a thousand years in the future defined the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as "a bunch of mindless jerks who were the first against the wall when the revolution came." (The Hitchkiker's Guide to the Galaxy)<br/>"Life – loathe it or ignore it, you can’t like it." Marvin the paranoid android. (The Hitchkiker's Guide to the Galaxy)<br/>“Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful one-more popular than the Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better selling than Fifty More Things to do in Zero Gravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway?” Description of the Hitchhiker’s Guide book. (The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy).<br/>“The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a very unevenly edited book and contains many passages that simply seemed to its editors like a good idea at the time. One of these supposedly relates the experiences of one Veet Voojagig, a quiet young student at the University of Maximegalon, who pursued a brilliant academic career studying ancient philology, transformational ethics and the wave harmonic theory of historical perception, and then, after a night of drinking Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters with Zaphod Beeblebrox, became increasingly obsessed with the problem of what had happened to all the biros he'd bought over the past few years. There followed a long period of painstaking research during which he visited all the major centres of biro loss throughout the galaxy and eventually came up with a quaint little theory which quite caught the public imagination at the time. Somewhere in the cosmos, he said, along with all the planets inhabited by humanoids, reptiloids, fishoids, walking treeoids and superintelligent shades of the colour blue, there was also a planet entirely given over to biro life forms. And it was to this planet that unattended biros would make their way, slipping away quietly through wormholes in space to a world where they knew they could enjoy a uniquely biroid lifestyle, responding to highly biro-oriented stimuli, and generally leading the biro equivalent of the good life. And as theories go this was all very fine and pleasant until Veet Voojagig suddenly claimed to have found this planet, and to have worked there for a while driving a limousine for a family of cheap green retractables, whereupon he was taken away, locked up, wrote a book, and was finally sent into tax exile, which is the usual fate reserved for those who are determined to make a fool of themselves in public. When one day an expedition was sent to the spatial coordinates that Voojagig had claimed for this planet they discovered only a small asteroid inhabited by a solitary old man who claimed repeatedly that nothing was true, though he was later discovered to be lying. There did, however, remain the question of both the mysterious 60,000 Altairan dollars paid yearly into his Brantisvogan bank account, and of course Zaphod Beeblebrox's highly profitable second-hand biro business.” (The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy).<br/>“There are of course many problems connected with life, of which some of the most popular are Why are people born? Why do they die? Why do they want to spend so much of the intervening time wearing digital watches?” (The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy).<br/>"You just let the machines get on with the adding up, and we'll take care of the eternal verities thank you very much. You want to check your legal position you do mate. Under law the Quest for Ultimate Truth is quite clearly the inalienable prerogative of your working thinkers. Any bloody machine goes and actually finds it and we're straight out of a job aren't we? I mean what's the use of our sitting up half the night arguing that there may or may not be a God if this machine only goes and gives us his bleeding phone number the next morning?" Majikthise (The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy).<br/>"We demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty!" Vroomfondel (The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy).<br/>"It is of course well known that careless talk costs lives, but the full scale of the problem is not always appreciated. For instance, at the very moment that Arthur said "I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle," a freak wormhole opened up in the fabric of the space-time continuum and carried his words far, far back in time across almost infinite reaches of space to a distant Galaxy where strange and warlike beings were poised on the brink of frightful interstellar battle. The two opposing leaders were meeting for the last time. A dreadful silence fell across the conference table as the commander of the Vl'hurgs, resplendent in his black jewelled battle shorts, gazed levelly at the G'Gugvuntt leader squatting opposite him in a cloud of green sweet-smelling steam, and, with a million sleek and horribly beweaponed star cruisers poised to unleash electric death at his single word of command, challenged the vile creature to take back what it had said about his mother. The creature stirred in his sickly broiling vapour, and at that very moment the words “I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle” drifted across the conference table. Unfortunately, in the Vl'hurg tongue this was the most dreadful insult imaginable, and there was nothing for it but to wage terrible war for centuries. Eventually of course, after their Galaxy had been decimated over a few thousand years, it was realized that the whole thing had been a ghastly mistake, and so the two opposing battle fleets settled their few remaining differences in order to launch a joint attack on our own Galaxy-now positively identified as the source of the offending remark. For thousands more years the mighty ships tore across the empty wastes of space and finally dived screaming on to the first planet they came across-which happened to be the Earth-where due to a terrible miscalculation of scale the entire battle fleet was accidentally swallowed by a small dog." (The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy).<br/>"R is a velocity measure, defined as a reasonable speed of travel that is consistent with health, mental wellbeing and not being more than say five minutes late. It is therefore clearly an almost infinitely variable figure according to circumstances, since the first two factors vary not only with speed taken as an absolute, but also with awareness of the third factor. Unless handled with tranquility this equation can result in considerable stress, ulcers and even death. R17 is not a fixed velocity, but it is clearly far too fast." (The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy).<br/>"The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases. For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question How can we eat? the second by the question Why do we eat? and the third by the question Where shall we have lunch?" The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. (The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy).<br/>"There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened." (The Restaurant at the End of the Universe).<br/>"In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. Many races believe that it was created by some sort of God, though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle VI believe that the entire Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure. The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call The Coming of The Great White Handkerchief, are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each, who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel."
