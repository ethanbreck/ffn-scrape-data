You are now entering OnthaEdge487's Bio . . . proceed with CAUTION, for a flying monkey could randomly jump out at you (that's the least of your troubles.) Read at your own risk.<br/>(lol, I'm such a loser . . .)</p><hr/><p><strong>Updated: 2/20/04</strong></p><p>Hey guys! I haven't updated this thing in ages. Or my fics . . .heh. I'm sorry to say, I have rapidly been loosing my interest in wrestling, and haven't watched in quite a while. I still like Matt Hardy though. *smirks* Anyways, I doubt any of the fics below will get updated anytime soon. Who knows though, maybe this summer I'll get inspired and write a bit more. I feel horrible just putting everything on official hiatus like this, but I'm just not inspired, nor do I really have the passsion anymore to write wrestling fiction.</p><p>HOWEVER, I do have another pen name at the moment: The Slash Faerie (stupid, I know), and I'm focusing on writing and reading Harry Potter fanfics (more or less slash of course, it's an addiction). So if you've into that, you can check out my fics (I only have two up, there was 3 but ff.net took one down . . .*sniffle*), on that pen name. Alrightie, I'm done for now.</p><p>Spuds and Mattitude,</p><p>~*~OnthaEdge487~*~</p><p>(Below this line, my bio has NOT been updated. I'm a bit lazy, and the thing is like 20+ pages. Heh.)</p><hr/><p>The link isn't a site, it's a yahoo group. It's got a pretty big photo gallery, and I'm lenient on the rules. Anything involving the WWE Slash is discussed, and fan fiction is accepted (mainly slash . . . duh it's a slash group lol). The only thing I do ask it that people respect each other's opinions, and try to get along. So, if you are interested, please come and check it out.

I doubt I'm ever going to finish a fic . . . I always start a fic, then get inspired by something else, and start to write a different story and so on. It's just a pattern I go through. So now, I have about 13+ nowhere near unfinished fics (some I haven't posted hear . . .yet), that I might never finish. But one day, I don't care if it takes 20 years, I'm going to finish at least one story. Damn it.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">ON HOLD</span>: </strong></p><p><em>WWE Spring Break in Cancun</em></p><p>(Co-written by Live4thaXtreme)</p><p>We've finally started it, not much, a few paragraphs of stupidity, and non funny stuff, but eh. We're hoping to work on it some more this week, maybe even get the bulk of it done, but don't expect much, because I have the attention spand of a goldfish, and Melinda is just a complete idiot . . hehehe. *gets smacked in the head with a ham by Live4thaXtreme*</p><p>I know some of people, probably no one, are going to be pissed about this, but this fic is on hold for a while. I know, I haven't updated in a while, but I'm having a lot of trouble finding good and entertaining material for chapter 11. I'm hoping to have chap 11 at least started, maybe even done by the end of the summer . . .but I'm not promising anything. If anyone has any ideas for this fic, <strong>PLEASE</strong> email me (above), and I'll take it into consideration. You'll of course, get full credit for you idea.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Discontinued Fics</span></strong>:</p><p><em>It's Not So Easy Being A Teen</em></p><p>Well at least for now, I might start it up again sometime in the future, but I'm not promising anything. If I do decide to continue this, I'll probably re-write it, and it'll be A LOT different . . .</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Finished Fics:</span></strong></p><p><em>Who Did It?</em></p><p>If you even consider that a fic . . . more like a sucky rant actually</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">In the Works</span>:<br/></strong></p><p><em>Dinner with Dudley</em></p><p><strong>CHAPTER ONE UP</strong>! I never put it on my bio as a fic I was working on, because I just suddenly wrote it in one day . . . it just took me forever to put it up. This is my first Harry Potter fic . . . it's kinda weird. Ah well. Check it out if you like HP and crew, and tell me what ya think.</p><p><em>Life's a Bitch</em></p><p>Chapter 4 is done, I just have to edit it and type it up. I think it's really odd and sucky but eh. Not much detail to to it, more along the lines of to how the characters feel . . .which is basically confused . . .so the chapter's basically confusing . . . what can I say, that's just how my mind works. It'll hopefully be up soon, I'm having a hard time finding time to sit and get the damn thing typed though.</p><p>CHAPTER 3 IS UP!!! HELL YEA!!! *does happy dance* It's kind of the 'filler' chapter of the story, but does hold a great deal of signifigance as well . . . ah, I confused myself again! It'll hopefully good. At the moment, my Christian/Jay musi have been bugging me about this . . . that's basically why this chapter is even done. Damn, can they whine! Check it out and tell me what ya think.</p><p><em>Sweet Frusteration</em></p><p>CHAP 1 UP! I'm so proud, I finished this chap in like a day or so . . .that never evvvvvvvvver happens . . .It usually takes days, weeks, months to finish a chap. I know, I'm a slow writer. This the Matt Hardy/Adam 'Edge' Copeland fic I mentioned before. Matt and Adam are on their way to a houseshow when things turn for the worst. Or does it? I labeled it romance and action/adventure, because they both will be in the story. Romance plays a bigger part however, this fic being slash. The action/adventure however, isn't that much . . . I figure Matt and Adam are going to experience something a normal person wouldn't on a regular daily basis . . .but you'll see what I mean. Aw damn, I confused myself. Well, Check this one out, cause I'd like to know what ya think.</p><p><em>New Beginning<br/></em><br/>I've started chapter 2, it'll hopefully be up soon. Hopefully being the key word there. I honestly think this is one of my better fics. I got this done earlier than I excepted. *pats herself on the back* It’s an Amy (Lita) fic mostly. And of course the Hardyz play a huge part . . . I'm thinking E&amp;C, Jericho, Shane Helms, Shannon Moore, Trish &amp; Steph might be in it too. It's a high school fic, but not like a regular one. Amy just moved into a huge (I mean huge . . . think of the house in 'The Others'), in Salem, Mass. She's not too thrilled that she has to start a whole new life. But that's not her only problem. What 'surprises' does this new place have in store for her? What . . . I mean who will she meet? I think you get it . . . or not . . . eh.</p><p><em>Santa's Workshop</em></p><p>1ST CHAPTER IS UP! OH HELL YEA! I told you I didn't abandon this fic . . .it was just taking an incredibly long time to get the 1st chapter out . . .whew, after the long strenuous hours of attempting to write it, I'm exhausted. If you ppl still want to read it, I'll put it up hopefully start the next chapter soon. But I'm thinking that this idea really sucks . . . heh.</p><p><em>You Learn Something New Everyday</em></p><p>I'm stuck with this one at the moment . . . hopefully my Matt Musi can put the thier heads together and figure something out, because I don't want to see this fic die . . . nah, I won't let it, but who knows when I'll update it.</p><p>CHAPTER ONE UP! *does freaky happy dance* I’m on a freaking role! I've updated like 4 things in less than a month . . . that’s extremely odd for me . . .*feels forehead for signs of temperature* Um . . . the fic is about Matt Hardy I guess. This has most likely been done before; I have no idea considering I'm oblivious to the world. But it has been in the back of my head for a while . . .I think I've acquired a Matt muse! WOOOOHOO! The lil bastard wouldn't leave me alone until I sat done and wrote a paragraph or two. He likes all the attention I give him, lol. What can I say, I guess that's what a loyal Mf'er does, right? Oh right, back to the fic. Matt starts reading fan fics, and finds this site . . . and he's shocked at some of the stories he finds. And let's just say that his life changes . . . Yea I know, really shitty summary. I'm trying not to give anything away. Plus I don't really know what it's about yet . . . heh . . .</p><p><em>Torn</em></p><p>I'm in the process of writing chapter 12 . . .it's been pretty tough, but don't worry good citizens, I'm not going to give up on this one. I see the potential in this fic, my very first one, and I think I can make it pretty good with a lot of hard work . . . so I'm going to work extra hard on this chapter. It'll hopefully be done by the end of the summer, but I'm not sure.</p><p>I know everything I want to happen, the only problem is writing it. Every time I go to write it, the words come out wrong and it sounds bad . . .</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fics to Look For</span>:<br/></strong></p><p>These are either fics I'm working on at the moment, or fics I would like to work on in the near future. I'm not saying that you'll see all of these on ff.net, because I tend to jump from idea to idea and fic to fic, so it'll be a miracle if I can get a chapter for one of these done . . .</p><p><em>Out of My Life</em></p><p>Not sure if I'm going to post this, but eh.</p><p><em>Hollowman </em></p><p>Matt Hardy/Shane O'Mac fic . . .grrr I'm having issuses with the 1st chapter! I'm stuck in Shane 'rant' mode . . .</p><p><em>Underneath it All</em></p><p>Part AU fic...involves fairy tales...</p><p><em>It's Ain't Easy Being Me</em></p><p>Matt and Torrie fic, I'm not sure if it's going to be a romance, cause I suck at those. . .but it's got a pretty weird, yet totally overdone plot. Damn it. I'm almost done with the 1st chap.</p><p><em>Musi Madness</em></p><p>Not sure if I'm ever going to finish the 1st chap or ever post it . . .If I do, this would only be updated if I get extremely bored, or the Musi push me to do it.</p><p><em>WWE Family Fued</em></p><p>Ditto</p><p><em>Everything About You</em></p><p>It's a Test/Stacy song fic I've been wanting to write . . . I just can't find the words for it, or the time.</p><p><em>A Stroll Down Memory Lane--and Nightmare City</em></p><p>This is a Hardys slash fic I really want to write . . .it would be my first Hardy pairing, but hey, I'm always up for a challenge. I have a plot figured out . . . well kinda. But it would be pretty agnsty . . . blame it on Older Bro Matt muse, he was brooding at the time because he almost wasn't there to save Rainbow Bright from breaking practically every bone in his body when he tried to jump off my cement fireplace . . .funny Musi, I have.</p><p><em>Control</em></p><p>This would be the Matt/Y2J fic I've been dying to write. Got the main plot figured out, but no time to write it at the moment . . .plus, it would probably suck . . .</p><p><em>Enter the Imagi-Nation</em></p><p>I'm going to start on this pretty soon, because I think it's one of the better ideas I've had for a fic . . .but I'm not gonna tell ya what it's about, cause it'll ruin the suprise! And yes, Jeff Hardy is going to be in it, for all you rabid Jeff fans. This is more of a fic where I would ask the readers what they would like to see in it, and let them run the show more than me . . . and NO, it's not a MarySue . . .</p><p><em>Best of Me</em></p><p>Yet another Hardys slash fic I want to write, and it would be a song fic, inspired by the song 'Best of Me' by The Starting Line. I really need to stop listening to so much music, it inspires me way too much . . . more than my Musi, who barely do nothing but make out with either other, bitch at either other, or do stupid things, causing my house to look like crap.</p><p><em>Grease WWE Style</em></p><p>I'd think of a better title ... maybe. I have the characters who'd be in it, and even though I'm not a huge fan of the movie Grease, I think it'd be cool to do a parody with the movie and the WWE Superstars. Of course, this will either never be written, or take ages to be put up, so don't hold your breath. I'm sure this had been done before anyways...</p><p><em>Viva Las Vegas</em></p><p>Hopefully the Sequel to WWE Spring Break ... I'd love to write a sequel for Spring Break. Of course, we have tofinish the orignal first.</p><hr/><p>Let's see where do I start? I can be very crazy and psychotic at times, my friends'll tell you. I'll admit, I'm honestly not normal, and quite frankly a few cards short of a deck. But who is completely normal anyway? I enjoy going shopping, writing (except in school), going to the movies, listening to music (usually rock) and a bunch of other stuff I can't think of right now. When I get pissed at someone I call out my flying monkeys to attack them... Yeah you guessed it, I'm the wicked bitch, I uh mean witch of the west (well, actually her cousin 5 times removed). Oh and I despise school. It's what I picture hell will look like... What am I saying? School=HELL . . . yep that's about right.</p><hr/><p>I must say I absolutely love wrestling. Usually it's WWE, but if it's (pro) wrestling I'll watch it. Every single person who works for the WWE has my admiration (heel or no heel). The superstars put their bodies on the line every night and put on a great show just to entertain us, the fans. They endure physical pain everyday, and then go and do it all again the next night. A lot of us can't say we would be able to do that, myself included.</p><hr/><p>Okay b4 I go on I must say that RAW, November 25th WAS one of the BEST nights of my pathetic life. I personally think SMACKDOWN!(due to apparent reasons *cough* Matty *cough*)is the better show, but seeing Christian &amp; Jericho in their birthday suits topped ANYTHING and EVERYTHING I've seen so far on WWE TV. Scratch that, it's topped anything &amp; EVERYTHING I've seen in my entire LIFE! Damn they look good in towels . . . *drools* Whoever came up with that story line IS a GOD! I'm eternally grateful to them &amp; those damn Dudleyz! I'd also like to say that I'm *so* happy that the Dudleyz reunited, they kick MAJOR ass!</p><hr/>I'D LIKE TO GIVE A HUGE THANK YOU TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO PUT MY FICS ON THEIR FAVORITES LISTS!!

Heh, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery . . . yea. Please. . . Don’t hurt me . . . *hides in corner*<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">My Musi</span></p><p>I'm acquiring them left and right! Woooohooo! It's taken me forever, but now I got them! *throws confetti* Now all I need is a Shane McMahon (he's much needed . . .), and maybe even a Angle muse and I'll be happy.</p><p><strong>Matt Musi</strong></p><p><strong>Older Brother Matt</strong>- He’s the strong, older brother type, who's always cleaning up after everyone else. He likes to stay secluded from all my other musi, and just reflect on life. He's most likely the wisest musi there . . . I'm not sure if he's slashy or not . . . hmmmmmm. However, ever since my 2 Jeff Musi came into his life, he's been more affectionate, and open to peope... well them. He tries to cheer angsty Jeff up, and keep him safe. He also protects Rainbow, and takes care of him after he jumps off of something very heigh. I'm thinking Matt's got feelings for both of them...hmmm.</p><p><strong>Slashy Matt- </strong>He has a serious side when it comes to relationships, but he's usually quite playful. Kind of like an overgrown puppy . . . Slashy Matt likes to pounce on Slashy Christian muse whenever he can, and likes to start trouble with Smitten Matt &amp; Amy, by trying to impersonate Smitten Matt just to piss them off and get slashy Christian/Jay jealous.) He can be quite the romantic, but someone's got to dig it out of him. I'm praying he'll help me the whole romance factor in 'Life's a Bitch' and 'Sweet Frusteration' and all the other slash fics I'm planning to write . . . I suck at romance, and he's just the muse to help.</p><p><strong>Smitten Matt</strong> (is with Smitten Amy Muse 24/7) *whines* How come Chimera gets a Slut Matt muse, and I get stuck with a smitten one? And the worst part is, he nearly has a cow when I ask him to be paired up with anyone but Amy . . . I thought he was going to have a breakdown when I told him about 'Torn' . . .and now what I'm thinking about doing with him in 'It Ain't Easy Being Me', which might be up soon. Grr...</p><p><strong>Master of Mattitude</strong>- Likes to spend his time lecturing my other musi about the wonders of Mattitude, and at times even holds classes for them, so that they too can become M'fers. He's cocky, yet deep down has a sweet side. Surprisingly, he's well liked by the majority of the other musi, especially by Whiny Christian. At this point, Master of Mattitude's trying to help Christian get over his tantrums, and be a good boy. Hmmmmm slashy musi here too? I wonder . . .</p><p><strong>Christian/Jay Muse</strong></p><p><strong>Slashy Christian/Jay Muse</strong>- He's been getting quite angsty lately. Hence his character in 'Life's a Bitch'. Although he is quite happy when he's around Slashy Matt and Slashy Edge, but when he's alone, he gets quite uncomfortable and sad. Maybe once I finish the fic he'll go back to normal . . .I hope . . . he's just so damn cute. Spends his time eyeing Slashy Matt muse . . . and I'll stop there. Although he has given notice to Slashy Edge muse, and both he and Slashy Matt have agreed on a plan to make Slashy Edge part of their crowd.</p><p><strong>Whiny Christian/Jay</strong>- He's like an overgrown baby at times . . . well most of the time. He likes to spend his time pestering me . . . and well he ALWAYS gets his way . . . damn it.</p><p><strong>King of Awesomeness Christian Muse</strong>- He’s stuck in the world of the E&amp;C Dynasty, and uses Edge &amp; Christian's phrase's 24/7. He never stops. Over, and over and over with those damn phrases! Ah, but he's still a great muse. He promises to help me out in WWE Spring Break in Cancun . . . woohooo! Cause I need it! *bows to KoACM* Wow, he really does reek of awesomeness. Hehe.</p><p><strong>Lita/Amy</strong></p><p><strong>Lita Muse</strong>- She's usually in a pissy mood . . . and can be very bitchy. I have to keep her away from my other musi, because her favorite thing to do is beat the crap out of someone. She thinks SM &amp; SL are sissies, and need to cut the lovey dovey crap. Lita does however have a thing for Older Brother Matt . . . no idea why. I think she likes the fact that he can take care of himself, and others. She does have a lighter, funnier, nicer side, but that only comes out once and a while . . . and not just anyone gets to see it.</p><p><strong>Smitten Amy Musi</strong>- She’s usually making googley eyes at Smitten Matt Muse.</p><p><strong>Edge</strong></p><p><strong>Vampire Edge</strong>- Spends most of his time in his coffin or scouring the streets for some un expecting prey. He usually keeps to himself, although he doesn't seem to mind when Slashy Matt and Slashy Christian come on to him. He's helping me with 'Life's a Bitch' right now, and a fic I'm working on called 'Sweet Frustrations'.</p><p><strong>Scorch cake Edge</strong>- He, just like my King of Awesomeness Christian muse, is stuck in the E&amp;C Dynasty. They get along quite well . . . they’re rarely ever seen apart . . . hmmmmm maybe they're slashy musi and I just don't know about it . . . *scratches chin*</p><p><strong>Slashy Edge/Adam</strong>- He’s more of a loner out my 3 Slashy Musi. He watches both Slashy Matt and Slashy Christian a lot. He seems to be afraid to actually approach them . . . but that won't be the case shortly, if Slashy Matt &amp; Slashy Christian has anything to do with it. He's played a HUGE part in helping me with 'Life's a Bitch', and as you'll see once I flesh out his character more, Adam is quite like Slashy Edge. Creating Adam for that fic, along with another fic I'm working on called 'Sweet Frustrations' was a joint effort between Vampi Edge and Slashy Edge . . .they both tend to be loners . . .</p><p><strong>Jeff Musi</strong>: (I FINALLY got some Jeff Musi . . . WOOHOO! He was getting hard to write, damn it.)</p><p><strong>Angsty Jeff</strong>- He’s usually depressed, at times suicidal, just plain angsty . . . He’s helping me out in 'Life's a Bitch' at the moment . . . And he's become rather slashy. I'm quite pleased about this actually, so that I don't have to go out and get a slashy Jeff muse. The one he's got his eyes on in particular is Older Brother Matt . . .and he despises Rainbow for he and Matt's realtionship. The feeling is basically mutual. I think I'm going to have a Musi war on my hands between those two, and poor Older Bro Matt is going to be in the middle of it.</p><p><strong>Rainbow Bright</strong>- This is my dumb, completely insane Jeff Hardy. He has the brain mentality of a very stupid, yet innocent two year old. He promised to help me out in WWE Spring Break in Cancun . . . not like he has a clue where the hell Cancun is, mind you. He likes to pester Older Brother Matt Muse, and he passes the time by jumping off my dressers and such. One of my more interesting Musi, although I love them all.</p><p><em>Jericho Musi</em>: (WOOHOOO! Got me some Jericho Musi! I'm one happy girl! *does happy dance*)</p><p><strong>Slashy Jericho</strong>- Just another slash muse. He's a little dusty; considering he sleeps in the corner with the dust bunnies . . . He’s most likely going to stay that way until I can compel myself to write that Matt/CJ fic I've been wanting too. And that's if I can get him to play nice . . . he’s not the romantic type, more a devious, sneaky, yet slashy muse. But I want him to be sweet damn it! He can be . . . when he wants to be . . . grrrrr.</p><p><strong>King CJ</strong>- He truly believes he's the King of all that inhabits this world . . . I'm not going to even tell him that life might be on Mars . . .he'd claim that too. He likes to sit on my highest dresser, on his 'throne' (read WWE Spring Break for info on that LOL), with his little plastic crown, and orders my other Musi around. Not like any of the listen . . . except maybe Rainbow, but that's only because he's young and impressionable . . . and dumb, but that's not the point. CJ's very egotistical, and he's basically not much different from his character on T.V. But 'King' CJ KNOWS not to even think about bossing me around, or it's off to Musi Land he goes. CJ is at the moment looking for a Queen, or should I say, PRINCESS?</p><p><strong>Billion $ Princess</strong>- I'm surprised there's any Musi left in Musi Land, because when I said I wanted to 'adopt' some, I meant it. The form of Steph is like her old T.V. character, bitchy, slutty, manipulative . . . well you get the point. She's also helping out with Spring Break . . . I hope. See, she doesn't like to have anyone tell her what to do *cough or who cough* . . . that’s why I think she'd be great with King CJ . . . damn are they difficult sometimes.</p><p><strong>Stephie Muse</strong>- She’s like a normal person, with natural feelings . . .but she still has remnants of her T.V. character (her current one). She doesn't take crap from anyone, but she doesn't cause trouble. She's excellent with business . . .she likes to count my money, and at times advises me on my spending. She's one smart cookie, let me tell you. She and Billion $ Princess do not get along in the least . . .odd I know. Stephie can be somewhat of a romantic, and that's why I'm having her help my on 'Torn'.</p><p><strong>Hurricane Muse</strong>- Likes to fly around my room at all hours, night or day. He trys, try being the key word there, to be the peacemaker in my other Muses fights, and attempts to do the whole superhero bit, considering he believes he is one. He only talks in Hurri-talk, either using 'cool' superhero lingo, or adding the prefix Hurri to everything he says. He's definately helping me in Spring Break, because I really, really need help with it.</p><hr/><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fav Bands/Singers</span></strong></p><p>Trapt<br/>Breaking Benjamin<br/>Papa Roach<br/>Saliva<br/>Hoobastank<br/>Godsmack<br/>Incubus<br/>Cold<br/>Life House<br/>Trust Company<br/>Our Lady Peace<br/>Linkin Park<br/>Disturbed<br/>Staind<br/>Evanescence<br/>Puddle of Mudd<br/>3 Doors Down<br/>Third Eye Blind<br/>POD<br/>Audiovent<br/>12 Stones<br/>Drowning Pool<br/>Green Day<br/>Seether<br/>Lit<br/>Ra<br/>Red Hot Chili Peppers<br/>The Calling<br/>Bush<br/>Jimmy Eat World<br/>Dry Cell<br/>Adema</p><hr/><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Favorite Pairings </strong></span></p><p>(Yes, I'm trying to make this bio as long as I possibly can . . .)</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Wrestling Het Pairings:</span></p><p><em>Matt/Lita</em></p><p>My all time fav . . . it’s really the only one I'll read . . . of course, I haven't been reading anything Het lately.

They were adorable, damn it! *goes to sulk in corner*</p><p><em>Bubba/Trish</em></p><p>Okay, don't ask . . . I thought when they had that storyline where Bubba &amp; Trish were 'friends' it was totally adorable . . .</p><p><em>Hurricane/Molly</em></p><p>Come on, superhero and his sidekick . . .they were cute!</p><p><em>Dawn Marie/Matt Hardy</em></p><p>Um . . . I dunno . . . Okay, yes, I'm THAT obsessed with Matt Hardy where I can see him with just about any Diva and think it's cute . . . I know, I'm weird, wrong, whatever.</p><p>Those doesn’t include Original character pairings, but sometimes I can bear to read 'em. Yeah, yeah so I like to read Mary Sues, so what? Grrrr, but as of late, I think there's just WAY to many interactive Mary Sue's going on, which takes away the originality of a fic. They all seem the same to me now. I don't know, I just can't get into them. Sure, I'll sign up for some, and I intend on reading them, but they're all a like to me now . . . just my opinion though.</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Wrestling SLASH Pairings</span>:</p><p>Hehehe, my favorite kind of fiction . . . roughly in order, but I love them all, they're so purdy!!!</p><p><em>Matt/Christian (Jay)</em></p><p>To me, they're so much alike it's scary (hard to explain . . .) Plus the fact that they're my two favs . . .There's really not enough of this pairing . . .like anywhere. If I could actually learn how to write, I'd definitely write this pairing . . . over, and over, and over . . . hehehe.</p><p><em>Matt/Jeff</em></p><p>Hey, ya neva know, one of them could really be adopted so technically it's not incest! *sigh* Yea, right.</p><p><em>Matt/Shane McMahon</em></p><p>It's my new little obsession. I'm so in love with this pairing right now . . .*sighs dreamily* Too bad Shane's never on T.V. any more . . . *sob* I haven't found much on this pairing, just one series . . .actually, I haven't seen much of Shane O'Mac in slash . . .and if he is it's most likely with Trips or Kurt . . .eh. I'll scour the internet until I can find more of these two together . . . heh.</p><p><em><br/>Matt/Edge (Adam)<br/></em><em><br/></em>HELL YEA! Gotta be one of the hottest pairings I've eva seen! I love how they're 'fighting' back and forth in their commentaries . . . I wonder HOW much Edge loves to watch Matt eat corn . . . okay, I'm odd, let me be.~</p><p><em><br/>Matt/Y2J<br/></em><br/>Lately I've been reading a lot about them . . . damn I love these guys together, this is really one of my fav pairings. Maybe one day I'll even write a fic about them . . . haha yea right . . .me actually writing something decent, *falls over laughing* Oh good stuff!</p><p><em>Christian/Y2J</em></p><p>giggles* Ass cream . . . hehehehe. But seriously, they're interaction on Raw lately has just been so . . . well, slashy! Very nice to watch, let me tell ya.</p><p><em><br/>Edge &amp; Christian (Adam &amp; Jay)<br/></em><br/>SEXY BLONDE CANADIANS! I don't think I have to explain this one too much . . .I really do love this pairing. These guys are made for each other, it's just so damn cute!</p><p><em>Matt Hardy/Shannon Moore</em></p><p>I know, I know, I'm one obsessed M'fer. You could probably put Matt Hardy with virtually anyone in the WWE (het or slash fic), and I'd think it was the best thing since sliced bread. Well . . . maybe that's going a little too far . . . *thinks of an A-train/Matt fic* *heaves* Heh . . . But honestly, what pairing is better than the Master of Mattitude, and the Original Mattitude Follower? So many possibilities for this pairing . . . man I love it, lol.</p><p><em>Edge/Rey Mysterio<br/></em><br/>OMG, this is one of my fav pairings . . . don't ask why I put it all the way down here, I was having a hard time choosing so I stuck it here. Anywayz, if you really like these guys together, then go read 'Oh What Bloody Web We Weave' by Gingivere the Shadowreave (it's under her name), and Quicksilver the Archangel.</p><p><em>Edge/Y2J</em></p><p>See E&amp;C's answer.</p><p><em><br/>Jeff/Christian</em></p><p>In the fics I've read, their so cute together it's sickening . . . ya gotta love it!</p><p><em>Jeff/Edge<br/></em><br/>Again . . .

Plus it would be so cute, them being good friends and all.</p><p><em>Y2J/HBK</em></p><p>I just think they're personalities work well with each other . . . and they look mighty purdy together, heh.</p><p><em>Y2J/HHH<br/></em><br/>Not really a HUGE fan of Trips at the moment, but when he's with Jericho, I can make an acceptation.</p><p><em>HHH/HBK</em></p><p>I dunno . . . they look right together. Leave the unmediated person alone, they tend to bite! *bares teeth*</p><p><em>Y2J/Rocky<br/></em><br/>They looked cute when they were feuding, and I read this really cute fic about them that I loved . . . so I guess I'm a fan of the pairing.</p><p><em>Christian/Shane McMahon<br/></em><br/>Again, I read a fic with these two, and I truly loved them together. Not as much as Shane/Matt, but eh. I know they're a very unlikely pairing, but hey, who wants the usual all the time?</p><p><em>Randy/Trips</em></p><p>Thanks to Ellectra's fics, I'm a full fledged Randy/Hunter shipper! I absolutely love these two together . . . it’s like they're meant to be.</p><p><em>Jeff/Raven</em></p><p>It's grown on me, cause I really didn't like this pairing before. I guess it depends on the plot of the fic, and if it's well written. But yea, I'm really begining to like those two together, it's cute.</p><p>I'd just like to give some props to all the slash writers on here. You guys seriously rock! If anyone's ever looking for a good slash story click on my fav authors, since most of them are slash writers. Yea, I'm a disturbed little freak, so what?</p><hr/>Question of the um . . . I dunno it's just a stupid question:<p>Exactly <strong>HOW </strong>many testicles DOES Test have? *ponders*</p><p>I don't know, but I'd sure as hell like to find out for myself . . . *drools* LoL, sorry for the dirty &amp; non humorous joke. Test does look rather good w/short hair! And I LOVED the whole angle with him &amp; Stacy, it was cool &amp; they looked cute together. But of course, the WWE had to go and screw that up, right? They go and put Stacy with Steiner just to get cheap pops because he couldn't get the audience to cheer him on his own . . . Eh, who cares, no one's reading this &amp; if you were you're either asleep or lifelessly comatose. Hehehe . . . I'm boring, yet very opinionated, so sue me!</p><hr/><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Wrestlers/Character's in the WWE I can't Stand</span></p><p><strong><br/>The Sh*t List</strong></p><p><em>GOLDBERG </em></p><p>GET THE <strong>F' OUT</strong>! Heh . . . the WWE didn't need him to boost ratings, he didn't do shit to change them. And damn it, he needs to learn to shut his damn mouth before he swallows someone whole! I just can't stand how the only reason he's being hyped up so much is because he has a marketable name, but not really much in ring talent. It's like the Steiner thing all over again. First it's the scary ass peaks, now it's the never ending black hole that is Goldberg's mouth. It's as if the only reason Christian's getting pushed is because Goldberg's here. And how many unstoppable guys can we have in the WWE? I mean, that gimmick gets pretty old. Plus, he seems as if he's a total Prima Dona, which I'm sure doesn't bode well with the other superstars. In the WWE, you gotta be a team player, yet I don't think Goldberg really knows what the word team means . . . I just want Goldshit . . .I mean berg . . . Goldberg to go back where he came from, and stop wasting perfectly good air time, that could be used for some one with talent. That's my opinion, and I'm pissy at the moment . . . Okay I'm done.</p><p><em>BROCK LESNAR</em></p><p>He shouldn't have been pushed so much, so fast.</p><p><em>SCOTT STEINER</em></p><p>Ditto . . . and his peaks scare me. And the guy has no mic skills what-so-ever.</p><p><em>ERIC BISCHOFF</em></p><p>He actually isn't pissing me off that much right now . . .</p><p><em>Paul Heyman</em></p><p>I actually respect this guy, but his character gets under my skin.</p><p><em>A-Train</em></p><p>He's a good heel, and a good guy, but I don't like his character . . . so I guess he's doing his job then, eh?</p><p><em>Nathan Jones</em></p><p>Don't ask.</p><p><em>Jazz<br/></em><br/>She's tough, but let's just say she's not my fav diva.</p><p><em>Trish Stratus<br/></em><br/>She's been toned down a bit . . . for now. But still, what happened to all of the other Diva's? I think the Women's Division has gone to shambles, the WWE just isn't using it right, and they're letting excellent talent (i.e. Molly, Ivory, Jacqueline) go to waste. I do respect Trish however, but she can get old. I just believe she was forced down our throats at the time.</p><p><em><br/>La Resistance<br/></em><br/>Eh, they're growing on me. Kinda. Well, Rene is. I don't like that other guy... I can't spell his name... From what I've read, he has a pretty bad attitude backstage, and I don't like rookies, especially ones with attitude. But Rene seems cool, and he does show that he has talent...</p><p><em><br/>Bigshow</em></p><p>I used to like him, but now he's kinda boring, and just down right annoying . . . heh . . . I'm in a really pissy mood, ignore me, lol.</p><p><em>Booker T</em></p><p>I think the Spin-a-rooni has gotten old, and well, he like many others just pisses me off . . . and he's quite boring . . . to me anyways. Too bad he's injured though. Get well soon!</p><p><em><br/>Torrie Wilson</em></p><p>It's all about her on Smackdown! Heaven forbid it's a match between Nidia and Dawn, nooooo Torrie needs to make an appearance. I don't know, I'm just sick of her too, as I am with Trish. Hopefully things will be different when Lita gets back.</p><p><em>Gail Kim<br/></em><br/>I just didn't agree with the fact that she got pushed so fast, and the fact that she won the Women's Title on her 1st match. Once she earns my respect, she'll be off the 'shit list'...maybe.</p><p><em>Vince McMahon</em></p><p>I can't stand his T.V. character, and the fact that he thinks he's the best heel in the business pisses me off. I think it's just the things his character does and says that pisses people off, therefore making them dislike him, and give him heel heat. That's why I don't like him... and I usually LIKE the heels. It's just that the majority of them don't do what Vince's character does. And he has the nerve to go around backstage and tell all the heels to look at what he does to try and get more heel heat. I read something to this extent somewhere, mind you I don't believe everything I read . . .but of course, I wouldn't hold stuff like this past Vince. And I don't like how he's using a lot of his talent. A lot of excellent talent are just wasting away, when they should be headlining, or at least getting more airtime and publicity. Just my opinion though. If I ever work for that company (I'm dying to be on the creative team...at this point, though, I really don't know why) things will so be different, or at least I'll try to make em differnt . . . I don't give up that easily.</p><p><em>The WWE Writing Team<br/></em><br/>The storylines they're been coming up with as of late, especially for Smackdown! absolutley suck. I can't stand the Bigshow, Angle, and Lesnar are the ONLY guys who are allowed title shots for the WWE Title. It gets pretty boring after a while, and I can't stand when it's monster vs. moster all the time, and those guys are huge. I personally think someone like Benoit should get a title shot. And I just think they're going about the majority of the fueds on Smackdown! the wrong way... they should do more promos with the Superstars and less with Sable and the McMahons (Vince, &amp; Steph that is), so that the fued can really go somewhere, if they insist on keep it going for months upon months.</p><p><em>Steph McMahon<br/></em><br/>I know she's on my fav superstars list too, but I just don't like her character right now. And I can't stand the fact that they're putting her on ppv matches and on tv matches when they could be using that space for real wrestling. I read something about her, and it said that she was being kind of bitchy to the writers for being to critical on the product or something, and not to undermine Vince's authority or they'll be off it the team like Heyman. Something like that, don't take my exact words, but that was the jist. If she's like that backstage, then wow. I personally think the storylines have sucked for a while now, and if she and Vince want to keep them that way, then they're going to run the WWE into the ground eventually. I really wish they'd listen to what the fans want for a change, and take their opinions of what should happen and mold them into storylines. Just my opinion, but if they did that more often, there would probably be better ratings, and maybe even better matches and T.V. products.</p><p><em><br/>Kevin Nash<br/></em><br/>If he walks out of the Eliminations Chamber with the Title I'll die. I just can't stand him...I don't think he's that great in the ring, and so far, in my opinion Jericho has had to carry the matches they've had.</p><p><em><br/>Sable<br/></em><br/>Man do I hate her! I think she's just a waste of T.V. time. She doesn't seem to want to do anything but be an annoying pain in the ass. And I'm so sick of her storyline with Vince, can't they think of anything original?</p><p><em>RVD</em></p><p>I think he's an amazing athlete, but I'm really just not into him anymore. I haven't really liked him for awhile, but I've just been too lazy to put him up here.</p><p><em>Billy Gunn<br/></em><br/>I don't really like him... he's better in a tag team than in singles. I think they only put him with Torrie so he could get some pops. When I went to a houseshow he faced Matt Hardy *sighs dreamily* . . .Um anyways, Matt got a much bigger pop than Billy, and quite a few people were booing him, either that or chanting and screaming 'Torrie' or even something like 'Mattitude'/'V1'.</p><p><em>J.R.<br/></em><br/>I really don't like him... He's become extremely annoying this year. There's several reasons why he's up here, but I won't really go into them. Again, I'm just really lazy and forgetful, that's why he wasn't up here sooner. He was never my fav commentator, that would be Tazz, WOOOOHOO!. And King's annoying too, but sometimes I agree with him... wow, that's a scary thought.</p><p><em>Jeff Hardy<br/></em><br/>There's not much point now that's he's not in the WWE anymore . . . but I'm sure he'll be back. Eh, I'll explain myself (or at least try to), anyways. I RESPECT him, but he well . . more of his character . . .and his fans, pisses me off sometimes. I don't know, leave me alone! He's an incredible athlete (when it comes to ariel maneuvers). . . not many athletes are as crazy as Jeff, and not many can say they'd jump off a 15ft ladder in a heart beat. So, he gets huge props for that, and all the other memories he's given me. I wish him well with whatever he decides to do in the future. Good luck Jeff!</p><p><strong>My Top 15 Favorite Superstars</strong></p><p>(roughly in order)</p><p>(The # just keeps getting bigger &amp; bigger . . . &amp; so does this damn profile!! *angry mumbling*)</p><p>1) *MATT HARDY*~ Oh yea, it's all about the Mattitude baby! Matt's an inspiration to me, and he seriously doesn't get the respect he deserves. I know it sounds weird, but he's my romodel. Just his whole attitude about things, I don't think I've ever seen anyone more determined. It's like nothing is going to put him down . . . the never die attitude, 'I'm gonna prove you wrong' just rocks. He's continuing to improve, and it shows. His mic skills are getting great, he's truly hilarious! I think Matt has proven that he isn't going to 'fade away' as expected when he went into the singles division. He could easily be one of the most important superstars one Smackdown! with just a little more time and hard work . . .and he's well on his way. Personally, I think Matt's an incredible athlete, with great skill, &amp; an excellent work ethic. Wrestling just isn't his job, it's his LIFE. I find his character hilarious; I love the whole 'Mattitude' thing! It's SO cute the way he says it, with his accent &amp; all! Okay, I'm gushing now, so I'll just shut up while I'm ahead . . .</p><p>2)*Christian &amp; Edge*~ three words: SEXY BLOND CANADIANS!! WOOOOOOO! *dies* They’ve got skill &amp; they're HOT &amp; they've got nicer hair than I do! I wonder what conditioner they use... But seriously, they both bring valuable things to the table in the world of wrestling. They're both incredible athletes, who have incredible potential. I'm more of a Christian fan myself . . . He always owns his promos, and is awesome on the mic. And I haven't even gotten started on his in-ring skills yet . . . which are awesome. I think he deserves more of a shot than he's been given . . . but hey, at least it's a start.</p><p>3) *Los Guerreros*~ These guyz are the best tag team the WWE has right now. They crack me up! They have such chemistry, and they can make anybody look good. But what the hell . . . EDDIE CUT OFF THE MULLET? *cries* NOOOOO! Not the mullet, I loved the mullet! Now I can't call him Mullet Man or Latino Mullet anymore! *sob* Eddie is one of my all time fav wrestlers . . . in my opinion; he's one of the best they have right now. It's amazing to watch him compete. Chavo's great too, I was so bummed that he got injured! GET WELL SOON CHAVITO!</p><p>Chris Jericho*~ He should be the next World Champion, Damn it! I can't think of anyone more deserving. I'm praying he wins the Elimination Chamber, because he's truly the only one who I believe has really worked for it.</p><p>See E&amp;C's reason. Plus, Y2J IS a HUGE ROCK STAR, lol. *walks around like Y2J* He’s a heel yes. But he's funny as hell, and has excellent in-ring skill that helped him capture the Undisputed title, and that will help him get it again. NO, I'm not delusional (okay, maybe I am but that's not the point), I know he cheats very often, but if the ref doesn't see it then what ya gonna do? Have I mentioned he looks dead sexy in a towel . . . even better w/o it!</p><p>4)Shane McMahon~ I kinda deleted part of my Bio before, and never got a chance to put this back up...heh. Anyways, Shane rocks, simply put. In my opinion, he's a an awesome businessman, and even though he doesn't step in the ring that often, when he does it's truly memorable. He's definately a daredevil, and I'm SO happy he's back on T.V. The street fight involing Shane and Kurt Angle at KOtR 2001, is one of my all time favorite matches. I don't know, it was one that I was really into. *shrugs* It'd be cool if Vince just let Shane run things for a while, then maybe the storylines wouldn't be so crappy...then again, I could be wrong, but I doubt it.</p><p>Kurt Angle*~ Come on people, he's an OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST for crying out loud! Ya know ya love him! *bows head in guilt* Alright, I'm guilty, I *do* participate in the 'U SUCK' chants regularly, but it's only cause I know he really loves it. Plus Angle's such a dork; it can't offend him too much. But seriously, this guy can wrestle. He really doesn't suck, but we fans just love to get under his skin, don't we? I personally think he looks better bald . . . *shrugs* Plus, he's got to be one of the funniest guyz in the business. With Rock doing his movie &amp; Austin gone, &amp; no more E&amp;C there's not much humor in the WWE. Angle however, does make me laugh . . . although I'm usually laughing at him, not with him. *sigh* He’s still my OLYPMIC HERO, and the WWE wouldn't be the same w/o this milk loving mamma's boy. YAY, I'm SOOOOO happy he's back!</p><p>5)*Lita*~ She's got style, skill, one hot boy friend, and she can kick any diva's ass or guy's ass for that matter, in my opinion, anywayz! I really like her attitude when she gets in the ring. I believe she's the all around best diva in the federation. ANY DAY NOW! WOOOOOHOO!</p><p>Chris Beniot*~ he's an awesome technical wrestler, and I love his move the Diving Head butt. Unfortunately, he's pretty underrated. This guy has an awesome attitude about what he does, and he does it more than well. I mean, what more could you want? I really hope they give him the WWE Title soon . . . I’m so sick of big guys like Brock and Bigshow wearing it. Damn you Vince!</p><p>6)*Molly*~ One of the all around best Diva's they have. And one of the most underrated ones as well. She deserves more T.V. time, as do countless others. I'm just so happy she has the title though. It's about time they put it on someone with talent... It'd be cool to see her and Lita in a fued when Lita makes her return. Altough I wouldn't want Lita to win right a way...make the fued last for a couple PPV's so it'll actually mean something, since they don't really do that with Women's wrestling anymore.</p><p>Stone Cold Steve Austin*~ THE TEXAS RATTLESNAKE IS BACK! *imitating J. R.* STONE COLD, STONE COLD HE’S BACK! OH HELL YEA! When he came out, I screamed so freaking loud . . . I now kiss the ground that man walks on for what he did to Bitchoff. He's just one of the most entertaining guys in the WWE, simply put. WOOOOOOOOOO!</p><p>7)*John Cena*~ Word Life! I think he's character is awesome! He does have some talent when it comes to rapping . . . and in the ring as well. He along with quite a few people on this list, are the future of the WWE. He's no longer a rookie (heh, pet peeve of mine . . . disliking most rookies), so I've warmed up to him even more now . . .</p><p>Hurricane &amp; Shannon Moore*~ Yes I know that's 2 people, I CAN count ya know. My goodness they're great! They're a high flyers &amp; I think the whole superhero thing is hilarious. I really like what they're doing with Hurricane and Rosey. They'll make a good tag team, if that's what WWE descides to do with them...if not it'd be cool to see Hurricane go for the IC title. They really need to branch out the fueds, I'm really sick of seeing the same people fight eachother. And don't even get me started on the whole M'fer thing . . . damn, I didn't think I could love a storyline that much. However, I think they really should give Shannon a chance in the Cruiserweight Division. He's awesome, and I think he could bring a lot to the Division. They could even tie in the whole Mf'er gimmick by saying he used the ethics of Mattitude to win or whatever. I don't know...it'd be kinda cool though. I'd kill to get Hurricane's mask &amp; anythin of Shannon's...*starts to form 'the plan' as mission impossible music plays in background*</p><p>8)*Victoria*~ she's extremely tough, and I love her character. It's something different from all the other Divas, and to me, something more real. Heh, don't ask. Oh, and I love her theme music &amp; entrance!</p><p>Billy Kidman*~ Another high-flyer. I got a thing for them. He's got skill; he's good looking, and I LOVE his finisher, the Shooting Star Press! Fly baby, fly! Yes I have issues, haven't we established this? I'm so happy that he and Torrie tied the knot!</p><p>9)*Dudley Boyz*~ D-von . . . GET THE TATERS! . . . I mean tables! I did, I really did! Anywayz, these guys are such an awesome team, I love them to pieces. The make me laugh, and entertain me everytime they're on. I hope they capture the tag gold in the near future, because they deserve it. And I hope Spike gets more T.V. time . . .I love that little guy!</p><p>10) *Randy Orton*~ He’s young and talented, and to me has a promising career ahead of him. And that right there was my J.R. moment. Heh, I promise, it won't happen again.</p><p>11) *The ROCK*~ He's the People's Chump . . . Champ; I meant Champ . . . damn keys, he kicks ass, &amp; he's as funny as hell! The Rock is the kind of person the WWE needs right now, but of course, he's off making movies . . . damn it. The guy is a team player, he doesn't mind putting people over, and is truly one of the greatest. I just wish he would come back soon . . . and I hope the movies are worth the wait . . .well, duh, of course they well be, he's The Rock, the multi-talented mega-Superstar! *attempts The People's Eyebrow, but fails horribly* Damn, I can never get it right!</p><p>12) *Rey Mysterio*~ I wuv that lil guy to bits! *glomps Rey* I’m almost as tall as him! Okay, maybe not, but I'm considerably close. *cough* No I'm not *cough* Dude, his contacts are SO cool, and he's got to be the only guy who can wear pink &amp; look adorable. He looks like a bunny when he wears pink . . . *drools* hehehe *giggles insanely*. Wait, I DON'T giggle . . . wazupwitdat? Um, anyway he's got to be one of the most entertaining superstars to watch &amp; for that I love him! GO REY, GO REY! *pulls out pom poms &amp; begins to dance, oddly resembling a wild ape during mating season* I scared myself . . . *shudder* Uh yea . . . moving on . . .</p><p>Jamie Noble &amp; Nidia~ I just love those two. I love they're character's and Jamie's a great athlete. But he's pretty underated. I'm pissed that they're turning face though...they were my fav. heel couple! Okay, so they were the only heel couple I like, or can remotely think of at the moment, but that's not the point.</p><p>13) *Test*~ I'M A HUGE TESTICLE! Um . . . yea. I think he's doing great as a heel, I can see him really going places in this business. That is, if Vince gets off his high horse and stops pushing only the gigantic, roided up guys like Goldberg, Lesnar, Steiner, Trips, etc. (Okay, so they might not ALL be on roids, but eh.)</p><p>Rhyno~ Man, I'm lazy . . . I've been wanting to put him on here for a while. I've liked him for a while, and I couldn't wait until he got back, and now that he is I'm happy... but I think he might need a new character. Just my opinion. The whole man-beast thing is great, but they need to give it a little something... eh. I'm just happy he turned heel, it's better this way.</p><p>14) Lance Storm~ Amazing athlete. I liked him as a heel, and I think he'll do well as a face too, if they're going to make him one. I do actually like the promos with Goldust (Goldust is great!) but I was hoping Jericho was going to be the one to help Lance be un-boring or whatever. Not that the man was boring to begin with.</p><p>15)*The Game, Triple H*~ He's determined and focused. Not to mention built, but that's beside the point. He's a survivor; he showed people that when he came back from his injury and captured the Undisputed title. Plus, me &amp; him have got something in common: WE'RE PSYCHOS! WOOOOOOO! Man, as much as I want Trips to drop the title, I DON'T want Goldberg to win it! It'd a freaking lose/lose situation! Grr...</p><p>Stephanie McMahon*~ She's got that manipulative, 'don't mess with me' attitude that rocks, she's confident &amp; totally powerful. She's a successful business woman who can get what she wants, &amp; I hope to be as successful as she is when the time comes.</p><p>There I'm done. Fifteen (okay maybe more than 15, but eh, sue me already...no don't I don't got ANYTHIN' of interest, I swear! *hides money stash*) as I was sayin 15 is one of my favorite numbers, so I put my Top 15 fav Superstars. Actually 2 is my fav # but that would defeat the purpose. IS ANYONE STILL READING THIS? *cricket noises* Heh, now that I've bored all of you into a near *coma, I'm satisfied. I told you I was odd. Now, feel free to read my fics, which by the way are also odd and pretty crappy, but eh. Oh, and *email or IM* me anytime if ya want, it's better than talkin' to myself, lol. TTFN, Tata For Now! (I also love Tigger, don't ask why, you don't wanna get me started!) *cuddles Tigger stuffed animal*</p><p>Oh b4 I forget . . . SHOUT OUT TIME! Yeah so I said I was done . . . BITE ME! *bears teeth* Uh . . . anywayz the coveted shout outs go to . . . *drum rolls*</p><p>Live4thaXtreme~ (no duh) HOMEFRY . . . GET THE TATERS!!!!!!!!!!! Heh, yeah don't ask. Inside joke.

Gawd help you all. Hehehe. *smirks impishly*</p><p>Phoenix Fire Hardy~ Another awesome writer . . . hehe yogurt. Really cool person too. You've corrupted my mind you know that?
