I had nothing in my bio... Some one who talks as much as me with a bio free of ramblings? Never! Thing is, I don't have much to talk about. I went back to public school for a semester, but then I decided it sucked and went back to homeschooling. In December, I'll test out of highschool and get my GED, then I'll start college course's at the local community college. I have no idea how to spell college... Oh well.<p>What else to talk about? Uh... Well... I saw The Ring the other day. They call that movie brillant? Scary? The only scary part is all the heaps of plot holes! So many in one script... *shudders*</p><p>You know what I wanna be when I grow up? A director. I'm going to turn my favorite books into movies, and I'm going to do it *properly*. With as little burtchering as possible. I'm sure how well actors are going to like working for me, though. I'm a perfectionist, so they'll have to re-do every scene fifty million times... Oh well. Now all I need is to win the lottery so I can afffors to make a movie. I only need enough money to make one, then (hopefully) I'll make enough profit to make more. *sigh* Anyone got several million I can borrow? I don't think I would be able to get a bank to loan it to me... Does anyone know a desperate movie producer who has enough money and is willing to let a fifteen-year-old make a movie off of several books, none of which have won any awards? Anyone?</p><p>Has anyone noticed what FFN does to your stories? My format is WAY off. Not only that, I saw that I mispelled a word, so I went back to the original document on my computer to fix it, And it wasn't mispelled there! They're mispelling my words! Not only is FFN not working for me, my writing program is giving me issues. It won't let me add words to the ABC check, so I keep having to tell them to ingore Kenret, Tomora, Tortall, and other assorted names that appear often and aren't spelled wrong! Stupid thing. I can't NOT use it, 'cause I can't spell worth diddily, and if I type to fast, my letters get out of order. Poop!</p><p>You know what's a funny word? Mooch. It sounds like a cow sneezing at the end of it's sentence. "MOoooo-Chh!" Try it.</p><p>Um, favorite author's? Like you care! Why would you read a certain author's books just 'cause I recomend them to you? Because I said so, that's why! Now, these are published author's so look for hem in the library, not FFN.</p><p>Tamora Pierce-Kinda a low reading level, but good stories, nice writing. I don't know why I like her so much, but oh well. I now I'm not the only one, and her books are going to be the first that I turn into movies. (hopefully)</p><p>Piers Anthony- He's a guy, so once in a while the main character happens to notice a girl's low cut dress, but still, good stories. The Xanth series, not the Blue Adept. Actually, Blue Adept might be really good, but I haven't read any of them yet. The Xanth series has, like, a million books (40-50). I recomend starting with the first one, A Spell For Cameleon (I think that's how it's spelled!) if you can. If not, read Centaur Aisle first, It's the one that got me hooked. Don't read the more recent ones first. you'll understand them, but it's really a lot better to read the first ones first. They're better anyway. The entire series is based on puns. Now don't moan, it can really be quite charming. Funny too. I also has mythological creatures. Qool-kool!</p><p>Mindy L Klasky- Ack! I LOVE her The Glasswright's Apprentice series! Wonderful! She's very original, really check her out.</p><p>Kate Forsyth- My current favorite author! Her Witches of Eileanan books are great! Sadly, though, there is only one book left till the end of the series! Wah!:(</p><p>She'll write another series, of course. She's an author, that's what she does.</p><p>Actually, I may have these out of order... I think Klasky might be my favorite. She has such a bigger vocabulary than most authors do these days. It's very refreshing, reading intelligent thoughts.</p><p>Anyway, yeah, I'm going to go ahead a stop now. If you like long bios', than you love long stories, right? In that case, check mine out! So far it's the longest I've found on FFN, but that doesn't mean it IS the longest.</p><p>Random Complaint: GRR! I HATE my keyboard! It's always putting two of one letter, not acknowlodging that it typed another... Grr. It makes my grammar and spelling look so much worse than it really is... Every one thinks I'm dense...</p><p>Buy Girl Scout Cookies! They're good! Do you have any idea what it's like to stand out side in the front of a building for nine hours asking every single person if they want to buy cookies? You have to repeat it a hundred times for old people, everybody lies to you: "I'm diabetic" says the woman, and her friend breaks out laughing, saying, "no your not!". "I'm on a diet" says the one with a cart full of chips, soda, french fries, extra. A little old lady came out and answered. Oh, I can't. I'm..." pauses to think. "I can't have sugar?" She said, more of a question really, and she looked at me as if she were asking if that was a plausible excuse. I nodded and said, "Thank you anyway. Have a nice morning." she answered. "I did buy some, they're at home." then hurriedly adds, "they aren't for me though. I'm giving them away." "Of course," I replied. "Thanks you for supporting girl scouts. Then there are those people who say, "What was that? I didn't hear you."(by the way, she didn't have any sort of accent at all) "I asked if you would like to buy a box of Girl Scout cookies." "Oh, no, I'm sorry, I don't speak span- I mean, English." So I asked her in spanish. "Oh, I'm sorry, I speak french." You'd be surprised how often people will say they speak spanish. Usually the say, "I no hablo espanola/english" with no accent, pernouncing everything wrong, articulating the H in hablo, which two year olds know is silent. (Spanish it what everyone says. This IS New Mexico, after all. Or there's "oh, I'm *so* sorry. I don't have any cash" says the man. "Do you have credit cards?" I ask. "No." "Well then you can buy, because we don't take credit cards, but we do take checks!" "Well... I don't have any checks either." "Then you must have a debit card, because you're going gracery shopping, and you have to pay for them some how. If you have a debit card, why don't you use the ATM that's right over there?" "Uh, not my company. They charge you to use other's ATM's, you know" "Then being the devoted, concerned citizen that you are, I'm sure you'll remember to get cash back after you buy groceries, huh?" "No. I don't have enough money for it in my bank account." "You don't have three dollars? Then how do you plan to pay for the groceries you're buying? Did you just happen to have exact change in your account for what you're gong to buy?" "Um, yes." He stalks off. *sigh* Please folks, just say no and go away, so we can ask the people coming out after you. Oh, and all you teenage girls? Do NOT look at us like we are the biggest dorks in the world! WE get to go places for cheap, if not for free! And my parents trust me more, so I can go where ever with out them thinking I'm into sex, drugs, or alcohol! So THERE!!! :P Please buy cookies?</p><p>Die Silvery Minow!!</p><p>I'm not lazy, I'm just busy!</p><p>Remember, if the world didn't suck, we'd all fall off!</p><p>If Einstein knows so much about gravity - what's with his hair?</p><p>If you choke a smurf, what color does it turn?</p><p>Is a shelless turtle homeless or just naked?</p><p>What should you do if you see an endangered animal eating an<br/>endangered plant?</p><p>He who laughs last, thinks slowest</p><p>A day without sunshine is like, well, night.</p><p>I just got lost in thought.
